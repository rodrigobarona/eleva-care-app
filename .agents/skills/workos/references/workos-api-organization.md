# WorkOS Organizations API Reference

## When to Use

Organizations represent companies or teams in a multi-tenant application. Use this skill when you need to create, retrieve, update, or delete organization records, or when you need to map external system identifiers to WorkOS organization IDs for syncing data between your application and WorkOS.

## Key Vocabulary

- **Organization** `org_` — represents a company or team entity
- **External ID** — your application's identifier for the organization, used for cross-system mapping
