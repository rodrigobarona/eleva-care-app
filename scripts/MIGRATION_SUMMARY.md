# Scripts Folder Reorganization Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-29  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

## Overview

The scripts folder has been completely reorganized to separate one-time migration scripts from reusable utilities, consolidate similar functionality, and improve maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure

Created a new organized structure:

```
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utilities/              # Active, reusable utility scripts (10 files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _archive/              # Completed one-time scripts (9 files)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/        # Database and config migrations (1 file)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ one-time-fixes/    # Bug fixes and data backfills (8 files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Comprehensive documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md  # This file
```

### 2. Archived Scripts (Completed, No Longer Needed)

#### Migrations (`_archive/migrations/`)

- **migrate-redis-config.ts** - Migrated from `KV_REST_API_*` to `UPSTASH_REDIS_*` environment variables

**After:** 1 unified script

- `utilities/cache-manager.ts` - Handles all cache operations

### 5. Package.json Updates

#### Removed Obsolete Commands

```json

"cache:clear-clerk": "tsx scripts/utilities/cache-manager.ts clear-clerk"
"cache:health": "tsx scripts/utilities/cache-manager.ts health"
"cache:stats": "tsx scripts/utilities/cache-manager.ts stats"

// QStash Management

```

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Improved Organization

- Clear separation between active utilities and archived one-time scripts
- Easy to find and understand what scripts are available
- Reduced clutter in the scripts folder

### ‚úÖ Better Maintainability

- Consolidated similar functionality (cache management)
- Removed obsolete and redundant scripts
- Clear naming conventions

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Documentation

- Comprehensive README.md with usage examples
- Clear categorization of script purposes
- Migration summary for historical reference

### ‚úÖ Simplified Commands

- Consistent naming patterns
- Removed confusing duplicate commands

## Usage Examples

### Cache Management

```bash
# Clear Clerk cache for development
pnpm cache:clear-clerk --env=development

# Check Redis health
pnpm cache:health

# View cache statistics
pnpm cache:stats
```

### QStash Management

```bash
# Schedule all jobs
pnpm qstash:schedule

# List all schedules
pnpm qstash:list

# Show statistics
pnpm qstash:stats
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Test BetterStack integration
bash scripts/utilities/test-betterstack-health.sh

# Test all health endpoints
bash scripts/utilities/test-health-endpoints.sh
```

## Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **The following npm scripts have been removed:**

- `cleanup:duplicates` - One-time script, archived
- `cleanup:cache` - Replaced by `cache:clear-clerk`
- `qstash:setup` - Replaced by `qstash:schedule`
- `qstash:debug` - Use `env:debug` instead
- `qstash:env` - Use `env:setup` instead
- `validate:posthog-permissions` - Renamed to `posthog:validate-permissions`

## Migration Guide

If you were using old commands, here's how to migrate:

| Old Command                         | New Command                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `pnpm cleanup:cache`                | `pnpm cache:clear-clerk`            |
| `pnpm qstash:setup`                 | `pnpm qstash:schedule`              |
| `pnpm qstash:debug`                 | `pnpm env:debug`                    |
| `pnpm qstash:env`                   | `pnpm env:setup`                    |
| `pnpm validate:posthog-permissions` | `pnpm posthog:validate-permissions` |

## File Count Summary

### Before

- **19 files** in scripts/ root
- No organization
- Mixed one-time and utility scripts
- Duplicate functionality

### After

- **10 active utilities** in `scripts/utilities/`
- **9 archived scripts** in `scripts/_archive/`
- **1 comprehensive README.md**
- **1 migration summary**
- Clear organization and purpose

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ All scripts organized and documented
2. ‚úÖ Package.json updated with new commands
3. ‚úÖ README created with comprehensive documentation
4. üìù Consider removing archived scripts after 3-6 months if no longer needed for reference

## Notes

- All archived scripts are kept for historical reference and potential future debugging
- The `cache-manager.ts` utility consolidates 3 previous scripts into one unified interface
- All npm scripts now follow consistent naming patterns: `<category>:<action>`
- Environment-specific configurations are now passed as flags rather than separate scripts
