/**
 * RLS Policies for Missing Tables (Phase 4)
 * 
 * Enables Row-Level Security for 7 tables that were created after the initial
 * RLS migration but lack proper RLS policies:
 * 
 * 1. annual_plan_eligibility  - Expert subscription eligibility metrics
 * 2. blocked_dates            - Expert unavailable dates
 * 3. expert_applications      - Expert application forms (NEW - Migration 0016)
 * 4. roles                    - User roles for RBAC
 * 5. slot_reservations        - Temporary appointment reservations
 * 6. subscription_events      - Subscription change audit trail
 * 7. transaction_commissions  - Commission records for bookings
 * 
 * Security Model:
 * - Org-scoped access using user_org_memberships
 * - User-owned data (users can only access their own records)
 * - Admin access for review/analytics (role-based)
 * - Append-only for audit trails (subscription_events, transaction_commissions)
 * 
 * Prerequisites:
 * - 001_enable_rls.sql must be applied first (provides auth.user_id() function)
 * - Tables must exist (run migrations 0004, 0006, 0013, 0016)
 * 
 * Apply with: psql $DATABASE_URL -f drizzle/migrations-manual/003_enable_rls_missing_tables.sql

-- 10. TEST QUERIES (Use in development only)
-- ============================================================================

-- Test 2: Try to query a table (should only see own records)
-- Replace 'user_xxx' with actual WorkOS user ID
-- BEGIN;

-- ROLLBACK;

-- ============================================================================
-- NOTES
-- ============================================================================

/**
 * Important Security Considerations:
 * 
 * 1. auth.user_id() Function:
 *    - Provided by Neon Auth integration
 *    - Extracts 'sub' claim from WorkOS JWT
 *    - Returns NULL if no JWT or invalid JWT
 *    - Validated via WorkOS JWKS: https://api.workos.com/.well-known/jwks.json
 * 
 * 2. Enforcement:
 *    - RLS policies are enforced at database level
 *    - Prevents data leaks even if application code has bugs
 *    - All queries respect policies (unless role has BYPASSRLS)
 * 
 * 3. Performance:
 *    - Policies use indexed columns (workos_user_id, org_id)
 *    - EXISTS checks are efficient with proper indexes
 *    - Monitor with EXPLAIN ANALYZE if needed
 * 
 * 4. Audit Trail Integrity:
 *    - subscription_events: Append-only (no UPDATE/DELETE)
 *    - transaction_commissions: Limited updates (status only)
 *    - Required for HIPAA/SOC 2 compliance
 * 
 * 5. Admin Access:
 *    - Admins can view all data for analytics
 *    - Checked via users.role = 'admin'
 *    - Consider separate admin views for better performance
 * 
 * 6. Expert Applications Security:
 *    - High sensitivity (PII, credentials, resumes)
 *    - Users can only view/update their own application
 *    - Admins can review and update status
 *    - Users can only update if pending/rejected (not approved)
 * 
 * 7. Financial Data Protection:
 *    - transaction_commissions: Very sensitive (earnings data)
 *    - Users can view org-scoped commissions
 *    - System-managed via payment processing
 *    - Admins can view all for financial reporting
 * 
 * 8. Testing:
 *    - Always test with different user contexts
 *    - Verify users can't access other users' data
 *    - Test admin access separately
 *    - Use BEGIN/ROLLBACK for safe testing
