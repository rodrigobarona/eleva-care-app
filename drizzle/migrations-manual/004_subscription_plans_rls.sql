/**
 * RLS Policies for subscription_plans Table
 * 
 * This table was missed in the initial RLS migrations (001 and 003).
 * subscription_plans is organization-owned with subscription and billing management.
 * 
 * Security Model:
 * - Org members can view their org's subscription
 * - Billing admin can update subscription settings
 * - Only org owners/admins can create/manage subscriptions
 * - Only org owners can delete subscriptions (rare, for cleanup)
 * - Platform admins can view all subscriptions for analytics
 * 
 * Prerequisites:
 * - 001_enable_rls.sql must be applied first (provides auth.user_id() function)
 * - subscription_plans table must exist (migration 0015)
 * 
 * Apply with: 
 *   psql $DATABASE_URL -f drizzle/migrations-manual/004_subscription_plans_rls.sql

-- NOTES
-- ============================================================================

/**
 * Security Considerations:
 * 
 * 1. Billing Admin Role:
 *    - billing_admin_user_id tracks who set up the subscription
 *    - This user has permanent update access (for self-service billing)
 *    - Org owners/admins can also update (for delegation)
 * 
 * 2. Organization Scoping:
 *    - All policies use user_org_memberships for org-level access
 *    - Only active memberships grant access (status = 'active')
 * 
 * 3. Role Hierarchy:
 *    - owner: Can create and delete subscriptions
 *    - admin: Can create and update subscriptions
 *    - member: Can view org subscription (read-only)
 * 
 * 4. Platform Admin Access:
 *    - Admins can view all subscriptions
 *    - Useful for analytics, reporting, and support
 * 
 * 5. Deletion Protection:
 *    - Only owners can delete (prevents accidental removal)
 *    - Deletion is rare (usually subscription is canceled, not deleted)
