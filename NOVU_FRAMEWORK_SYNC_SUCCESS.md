# 🎉 Novu Framework Sync - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

## 🏆 **FINAL STATUS: 100% SUCCESS**

✅ **All 11 workflows successfully synced from framework to Novu Cloud**  
✅ **Zero dummy data - all workflows use real data**  
✅ **Production-ready infrastructure-as-code approach**  
✅ **Version controlled workflows in git**

---

## 🚀 **What We Accomplished**

### **✅ Problem Solved: Framework Sync**

- **Challenge**: Local framework workflows weren't synced to Novu Cloud
- **Solution**: Used production bridge URL for reliable sync
- **Result**: All 11 workflows now live in Novu Cloud with proper framework origin

### **✅ Cleaned Up Manual Workflows**

- **Deleted**: All 11 manual workflows from Development environment
- **Replaced**: With clean framework-generated workflows
- **Benefit**: No more conflicts between manual and framework workflows

### **✅ Production Bridge Success**

- **Bridge URL**: `https://eleva.care/api/novu` ✅ Working
- **Discovery**: 11 workflows, 8 steps detected
- **Sync Command**: `npx novu sync --bridge-url https://eleva.care/api/novu`

## 🔧 **For Future Development**

### **Adding New Workflows**

```javascript
// In config/novu.ts, add your workflow:
export const newWorkflow = workflow(
  'new-workflow-id',
  async (step, { payload }) => {
    await step.email('email-step', {
      subject: `Subject with {{payload.data}}`,
      body: 'Email content...',
    });
  },
  {
    tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],
  },
);
```

### **Syncing Changes**

```bash
# After updating config/novu.ts, sync to cloud:
npx novu sync --bridge-url https://eleva.care/api/novu --secret-key $NOVU_SECRET_KEY
```

### **Testing Workflows**

```javascript
// In your application code:
await novu.trigger('workflow-id', {
  to: { subscriberId: 'user-123' },
  payload: {
    /* your data */
  },
});
```
