## 1. Executive Summary

**Is DPO Mandatory for Eleva.care?**

According to **GDPR Article 37**, a DPO is **MANDATORY** when:

✅ **YES** - Your case meets criterion (c):

> (c) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of **processing on a large scale of special categories of data** pursuant to Article 9

**Eleva.care's Status**:

- ✅ Processes **health data** (Article 9 special category)
- ✅ Core business activity involves health data processing
- ✅ Healthcare platform for medical consultations
- ⚠️ "Large scale" determination needed (see Section 2)

**Recommendation**: **APPOINT A DPO** (even if borderline, it demonstrates GDPR compliance commitment and is best practice for healthcare)

---

## 2. "Large Scale" Assessment

**WP29 Guidelines on DPOs** (wp243rev.01) provide factors to consider:

### Factors Indicating "Large Scale":

| Factor                       | Eleva.care Status                   | Assessment                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Number of data subjects**  | [Current: ___; Projected: ___]      | [ ] Large scale<br>[ ] Not large scale |
| **Volume of data processed** | Health records for all patients     | ✅ Significant                         |
| **Duration of processing**   | Ongoing, indefinite                 | ✅ Continuous                          |
| **Geographical extent**      | Portugal + EU (potential expansion) | ⚠️ Regional                            |
| **Nature of data**           | **Article 9 health data**           | ✅ **HIGHEST SENSITIVITY**             |

**Conclusion**:

Even with a **small user base**, processing **health data as a core activity** strongly suggests DPO appointment is required or highly advisable.

**Recommendation**: **APPOINT DPO** regardless of current scale, because:

1. Health data is Article 9 special category (highest sensitivity)
2. Core business is healthcare service provision
3. Demonstrates compliance commitment to CNPD
4. Required for potential HIPAA compliance (if expanding to US)
5. Best practice in healthcare industry
