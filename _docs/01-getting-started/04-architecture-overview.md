## 7. Development Patterns

### 7.1 Server Actions

Server-side operations are implemented as Server Actions for secure data operations. These actions are organized in the `/server/actions` folder and handle various backend operations:

#### 7.1.1 Core Server Actions

- **Profile Management**
  - `updateProfile`: Updates expert profile information with validation
  - `toggleProfilePublication`: Controls profile visibility with prerequisite checks
  - `checkExpertSetupStatus`: Verifies completion of expert setup steps

- **Scheduling and Availability**
  - `saveSchedule`: Manages expert availability time slots
  - `getExpertSchedule`: Retrieves availability for booking interfaces

- **Event and Service Management**
  - `createEvent`: Creates new service offerings
  - `updateEvent`: Modifies existing services
  - `deleteEvent`: Removes services
  - `updateEventOrder`: Changes display order of services
  - `updateEventActiveState`: Toggles service availability

- **Booking and Meetings**
  - `createMeeting`: Creates appointments with validation and conflict checks
  - `cancelMeeting`: Handles appointment cancellations
  - `rescheduleAppointment`: Manages appointment time changes

- **Payment Processing**
  - `handleConnectStripe`: Initiates Stripe onboarding for experts
  - `createPaymentIntent`: Processes payment for bookings
  - `verifyExpertConnectAccount`: Validates expert payment accounts

#### 7.1.2 Implementation Pattern

Server actions follow a consistent pattern:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Verify user is authenticated
   - Check appropriate role permissions

2. **Input Validation**
   - Use Zod schemas for type-safe validation
   - Return early with error messages for invalid inputs

3. **Business Logic**
   - Perform database operations
   - Integrate with external services (Stripe, Google Calendar)
   - Handle transactional operations when needed

4. **Response Structure**
   - Return consistent response objects
   - Include success/error flags
   - Provide meaningful error messages and codes

5. **Audit and Logging**
   - Log important operations for audit trails
   - Track changes to critical data

#### 7.1.3 Error Handling

Server actions implement robust error handling:

```typescript
{
  success: boolean,
  error?: string,
  code?: string,
  message?: string,
  data?: any
}
```

This consistent structure allows client components to handle errors appropriately and display relevant feedback to users.

### 7.2 Data Fetching Strategy

- Server Components for direct database queries
- API routes for client-side operations
- Revalidation paths for data freshness

### 7.3 Error Handling

- Structured API responses
- Client-side error messaging via toast notifications
- Server-side logging
- Error boundaries for UI resilience

## 8. UI/UX Patterns

### 8.1 Component Hierarchy

- Atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Page layouts with consistent navigation
- Role-based UI rendering
- Responsive design for all devices

### 8.2 Theme and Design System

- Consistent color palette
- Typography system with font variables
- Spacing and layout guidelines
- Dark/light mode support

## 9. Performance Considerations

- Server components for reduced client JavaScript
- Optimized image handling
- Strategic data prefetching
- Pagination for large data sets

## 10. Security Measures

- Role-based access control
- Server-side data validation
- Encrypted sensitive data (health records)
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on API routes

## 11. Expert Verification and Publishing Process

### 11.1 Expert Setup Checklist

The platform implements a comprehensive verification process for experts through a structured checklist:

1. **Profile Completion**
   - Experts must complete their profile with personal information, expertise details, bio, and profile picture
   - The system validates that all required fields are filled

2. **Availability Configuration**
   - Experts must set their availability calendar
   - This defines when they're available for consultations

3. **Service Creation**
   - At least one service must be created
   - Services include details like duration, price, and description

4. **Identity Verification**
   - Experts must complete identity verification through Clerk's verification system
   - This ensures the platform only hosts legitimate healthcare professionals

5. **Payment Account Connection**
   - Experts must connect a Stripe account to receive payments
   - This enables secure payment processing for their services

### 11.2 Profile Publishing Mechanism

The profile publishing feature allows experts to control their visibility on the platform:

1. **Publication Requirements**
   - All setup checklist items must be completed before initial publication
   - The system performs a verification check before allowing publication

2. **Publication Control**
   - Experts can toggle their profile between published and unpublished states
   - When published, profiles become visible to potential clients
   - When unpublished, profiles are hidden from search and browse

3. **Server-Side Validation**
   - The `toggleProfilePublication` server action enforces all requirements
   - It checks for expert role authorization
   - It verifies all setup steps are complete before allowing publication
   - It handles the database update and path revalidation

4. **User Feedback**
   - The system provides clear feedback on publication status
   - When all steps are completed, a congratulatory toast notification appears
   - The notification includes a direct action button to publish the profile

5. **Progress Tracking**
   - A visual progress indicator shows completion percentage
   - Incomplete steps are clearly marked with action buttons
   - The system guides experts through the remaining steps in priority order

### 11.3 Metadata Management

- The system uses Clerk's user metadata to track setup progress
- Completion status is stored to prevent duplicate notifications
- The metadata is updated when steps are completed or become incomplete

2. **Navigate role-specific features** based on authenticated user
3. **Interpret form submissions** for profile or booking operations
4. **Explain verification requirements** for experts
5. **Guide through booking processes** for clients
6. **Help troubleshoot common issues** with appointments or payments
7. **Assist with expert setup checklist completion**
8. **Explain profile publication requirements and process**
