## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Resource:Action Pattern
```typescript
// Good (What we use)
appointments:view_own
appointments:create
events:edit_own

// Bad (What we avoid)
view_appointments
can_create_events
edit_own_events
```

**Why:** Consistent, scannable, grouped by resource

### 2. Role Inheritance
```typescript
Expert Top (49) = Expert Community (42) + Exclusive (7)
Clinic Admin (68) = Clinic Member (46) + Management (22)
```

**Why:** Easy upgrades, no permission loss, clear tiers

### 3. Ownership Scopes
```typescript
:view_own      // Only your data
:view_incoming // Data directed at you
:view_all      // All organization data (clinic)
// No suffix   // Platform-wide (admin)
```

**Why:** Clear data boundaries, RLS-friendly

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
```
Patient (15)
  → Expert Community (+27) = 42
    → Expert Top (+7) = 49
      → Clinic Member (+4) = 46
        → Clinic Admin (+22) = 68
          → Platform Admin (+21) = 89
```

**Why:** Clear upgrade paths, value propositions

- [ ] 6 roles created
- [ ] Roles have correct priorities (10, 70, 80, 60, 90, 100)
- [ ] Permissions correctly assigned to roles
- [ ] Default role is `patient`
- [ ] JWT includes `role` and `permissions` claims

### Application Code

## 💡 Common Questions

### Q: Can a user have multiple roles?
**A:** Yes, in different organizations. A user can be:
- `patient` in their personal org
- `expert_top` in their expert practice org
- `clinic_member` in a clinic org

WorkOS handles this via organization memberships.

### Q: How do I upgrade a user from Community to Top?
**A:** Update their subscription, then update their role in WorkOS:
```typescript
await workos.userManagement.updateOrganizationMembership({
  organizationMembershipId: membership.id,
  roleSlug: 'expert_top',
});
```
Their next JWT will include the new permissions.

### Q: Do I need to create Phase 2 roles now?
**A:** No. Only create Patient, Expert Community, Expert Top, and Platform Admin for Phase 1. Create Clinic roles when you're ready to launch clinic features.

### Q: Can I customize permissions per organization?
**A:** Yes! WorkOS supports organization-level roles. You can create custom permissions for specific clinics without affecting other organizations.

### Q: How do I test permissions locally?
**A:** Mock the JWT in your tests:
```typescript
const mockJWT = {
  role: 'expert_top',
  permissions: ['analytics:view', 'events:create', ...]
};
```

### Q: What if I need a new permission?
**A:** Add it to WorkOS Dashboard, assign it to appropriate roles, then deploy code that checks it. Existing users will get it on next JWT refresh (next sign-in).
