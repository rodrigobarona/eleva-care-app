### Step 3: Create Roles

**Order:** Create from lowest to highest priority.

**For Each Role:**

1. Click **Create Role**
2. Enter role details:
   - **Name:** Display name (e.g., "Patient")
   - **Slug:** `member` (lowercase, matches code)
   - **Description:** (See role descriptions above)
   - **Priority:** (See priority numbers above)
3. Assign permissions (use checkboxes)
4. Save

**Quick Copy Template:**

```
Role 1:
Name: Member
Slug: member
Priority: 10
Permissions: [List 15 permissions from Member section]

Role 2:
Name: Expert Community
Slug: expert_community
Priority: 70
Permissions: [All Member permissions + 27 expert permissions]

Role 3:
Name: Expert Top
Slug: expert_top
Priority: 80
Permissions: [All Expert Community permissions + 7 top expert permissions]

Role 4:
Name: Team Member (Phase 2)
Slug: team_member
Priority: 60
Permissions: [All Expert Community permissions + 3 team permissions]

Role 5:
Name: Team Admin (Phase 2)
Slug: team_admin
Priority: 90
Permissions: [All Team Member permissions + 23 team admin permissions]

Role 6:
Name: Platform Admin
Slug: superadmin
Priority: 100
Permissions: [ALL 89 permissions]
```

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

After creating all roles and permissions:

1. **Test JWT Claims:**

   ```typescript
   // Sign in as each role and verify JWT contains:
   {
     "role": "expert_top",
     "permissions": ["events:create", "events:manage", ...]
   }
   ```

2. **Test Permission Checks:**

   ```typescript
   // In your application:
   const hasPermission = await hasPermission('analytics:view');
   // Should return true for expert_top, false for expert_community
   ```

3. **Test RLS Policies:**
   ```sql
   -- Should respect permissions from JWT
   SELECT * FROM events; -- Should apply RLS based on permissions
   ```

## Role Assignment Workflow

### New User Signup

```typescript
// Default role assignment
async function onUserSignup(workosUserId: string, email: string) {
  // 1. Create personal organization
  const org = await createPersonalOrganization(workosUserId, 'member_personal');

  // 2. Assign default role (member)
  await workos.userManagement.updateOrganizationMembership({
    organizationMembershipId: membership.id,
    roleSlug: 'member', // Default role for all new users
  });
}
```

### Expert Application Approval

```typescript
// Promote member to expert after approval
async function approveExpertApplication(applicationId: string) {
  const application = await getApplication(applicationId);

  // Determine tier based on review
  const roleSlug = application.approvedTier === 'top' ? 'expert_top' : 'expert_community';

  // Update role via WorkOS
  await workos.userManagement.updateOrganizationMembership({
    organizationMembershipId: membership.id,
    roleSlug,
  });

  // Update organization type
  await db
    .update(OrganizationsTable)
    .set({ type: 'expert_individual' })
    .where(eq(OrganizationsTable.id, user.orgId));
}
```

### Subscription Upgrade

```typescript
// Upgrade from Community to Top tier
async function upgradeToTopTier(workosUserId: string) {
  // 1. Update Stripe subscription
  await upgradeStripeSubscription(workosUserId, 'top');

  // 2. Update role in WorkOS (automatic permission inheritance)
  await workos.userManagement.updateOrganizationMembership({
    organizationMembershipId: membership.id,
    roleSlug: 'expert_top', // Now has analytics:*, branding:* permissions
  });

  // User's next JWT will include new permissions
}
```

### Partner Member Invitation

```typescript
// Invite expert to join partner (Phase 2)
async function inviteExpertToClinic(expertEmail: string, clinicOrgId: string) {
  // WorkOS handles invitation
  const invitation = await workos.userManagement.createOrganizationInvitation({
    email: expertEmail,
    organizationId: clinicOrgId,
    roleSlug: 'team_member', // Start as member
  });

  // Expert maintains their own expert role in personal org
  // Gets additional team_member role in team org
}
```

---

## Permission Inheritance Examples

### Example 1: Expert Community → Expert Top

```typescript
// Expert Community permissions (42)
const communityPermissions = [
  'appointments:*',
  'events:*',
  'availability:*',
  'profile:*',
  'billing:view_*',
  // ...27 more expert permissions
];

// Expert Top = Community + Exclusive (49 total)
const topPermissions = [
  ...communityPermissions, // Inherits all 42
  'analytics:view', // +7 exclusive
  'analytics:revenue',
  'analytics:patients',
  'analytics:performance',
  'analytics:export',
  'branding:customize',
  'branding:upload_logo',
  'branding:custom_colors',
];
```

### Example 2: Team Member → Team Admin

```typescript
// Team Member permissions (45)
const memberPermissions = [
  ...communityPermissions, // All expert community (42)
  'team:view_dashboard', // +3 team view
  'team:view_patients',
  'team:view_schedule',
];

// Team Admin = Member + Management (68 total)
const adminPermissions = [
  ...memberPermissions, // Inherits all 45
  'team:manage_settings', // +23 management
  'team:invite_members',
  'team:remove_members',
  'revenue:view_overview',
  'revenue:manage_payouts',
  // ...18 more management permissions
];
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Permission Tests

```typescript
// Test 1: Member can't access expert dashboard
await expect(hasPermission('dashboard:view_expert', 'member')).toBe(false);

// Test 2: Expert Community can create events
await expect(hasPermission('events:create', 'expert_community')).toBe(true);

// Test 3: Expert Community can't access analytics
await expect(hasPermission('analytics:view', 'expert_community')).toBe(false);

// Test 4: Expert Top can access analytics
await expect(hasPermission('analytics:view', 'expert_top')).toBe(true);

// Test 5: Platform Admin has all permissions
await expect(hasPermission('users:delete', 'superadmin')).toBe(true);
await expect(hasPermission('analytics:view', 'superadmin')).toBe(true);
```

### ✅ Role Assignment Tests

```typescript
// Test 1: New user defaults to member
const newUser = await createUser('member@example.com');
expect(await getUserRole(newUser.id)).toBe('member');

// Test 2: Expert application approval updates role
await approveExpertApplication(applicationId, 'top');
expect(await getUserRole(expertId)).toBe('expert_top');

// Test 3: Subscription upgrade changes role
await upgradeSubscription(userId, 'annual_top');
expect(await getUserRole(userId)).toBe('expert_top');
```

### ✅ RLS Policy Tests

```sql
-- Test 1: Patient can only see own appointments
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims = '{"sub": "user_member_123", "role": "member"}';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments; -- Should only return their appointments

-- Test 2: Expert can see incoming appointments
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims = '{"sub": "user_expert_456", "role": "expert_community", "permissions": ["appointments:view_incoming"]}';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments WHERE expert_id = 'user_expert_456'; -- Should return all

-- Test 3: Admin can see all appointments
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims = '{"sub": "user_admin_789", "role": "superadmin"}';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments; -- Should return ALL appointments
```

## Validation Checklist

Before deploying to production:

### WorkOS Dashboard

- [ ] All 89 permissions created with correct slugs
- [ ] All 6 roles created with correct priorities
- [ ] Permissions correctly assigned to each role
- [ ] Inheritance working (higher roles have lower role permissions)
- [ ] JWT claims include `role` and `permissions` fields

### Application Code

- [ ] Permission constants match WorkOS slugs exactly
- [ ] Role checking uses JWT claims (not database)
- [ ] Middleware protects routes based on permissions
- [ ] UI shows/hides features based on permissions
- [ ] API endpoints validate permissions before actions

### Database (RLS)

- [ ] RLS policies use `auth.jwt_permissions()` function
- [ ] Policies check appropriate permissions for each action
- [ ] Test queries with different roles return correct data
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (permissions from JWT, not DB joins)

### User Experience

- [ ] Clear error messages when permission denied
- [ ] Upgrade CTAs shown to users without premium permissions
- [ ] Role badges displayed in UI (community/top/admin)
- [ ] Feature discovery works (users know what they're missing)
