## 🎯 Three Major Features

### 1. **Multiple Schedules** (Like Cal.com) ✨

**Problem Solved:**

- ❌ Old: Single schedule, no flexibility
- ❌ Can't have different hours for remote vs in-person
- ❌ Can't work at multiple locations

**Solution:**

```
Create Multiple Schedules:
├─ "Remote Work" (Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm, Video)
├─ "Team Tuesdays" (Tue/Thu, 2pm-6pm, In-person)
└─ "Evening Sessions" (Mon-Thu, 7pm-9pm, Remote)

Assign to Event Types:
├─ "Online Consultation" → Uses "Remote Work"
└─ "In-Person Session" → Uses "Team Tuesdays"
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Unlimited schedules
- ✅ Each with own hours, location, timezone
- ✅ Assign different schedule to each event type
- ✅ Perfect for hybrid work (remote + in-person)
- ✅ Perfect for multi-team experts

**Implementation:** 3 weeks (Phase 1B)

---

### 2. **Optional Calendar Integration** ✨

**Problem Solved:**

- ❌ Old: Google Calendar mandatory (barrier to entry)
- ❌ Users forced to connect external calendar
- ❌ No way to work without third-party integration

**Solution:**

```
Option A: App Calendar Only (No Integration)
├─ Store bookings in Neon database
├─ Built-in calendar view (Day/Week/Month)
├─ Filter by schedule/location
└─ Color-coded by event type

Option B: External Calendar (Optional Enhancement)
├─ Connect Google Calendar (optional)
├─ Connect Outlook (future)
├─ Connect Office 365 (future)
└─ Choose specific calendar per event type
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Works perfectly WITHOUT external calendar
- ✅ Built-in calendar view with Day/Week/Month views
- ✅ Calendar integration is OPTIONAL
- ✅ Choose which calendar to save each event
- ✅ No vendor lock-in

**Implementation:** 3 weeks (Phase 1C)

---

### 3. **Member Portal & Review System** (Like Airbnb) ✨

**Problem Solved:**

- ❌ Old: No member dashboard
- ❌ Members can't view their history
- ❌ No way to leave feedback/reviews
- ❌ Experts have no social proof

**Solution:**

```
Member Portal:
├─ 📊 Dashboard (overview, upcoming appointments)
├─ 📅 Appointments (view, reschedule, join)
├─ 📝 Session Notes (expert notes & recommendations)
├─ ⭐ Reviews (leave & manage reviews)
├─ 👥 My Experts (experts worked with)
├─ 💳 Billing (payment history & invoices)
├─ 👤 Profile (personal information)
└─ ⚙️ Settings (notifications & preferences)

Review System (Like Airbnb):
├─ 5-star overall rating
├─ Category ratings (professionalism, communication, etc.)
├─ Written review with highlights
├─ Automated request 24h after session
├─ Expert can respond to reviews
├─ Display on expert public profile
└─ Self-hosted (no Yotpo - saves $299+/mo)
```

**Why Not Yotpo?**

- ❌ Expensive ($299-$999/month)
- ❌ Not healthcare-specific
- ❌ Privacy concerns (third-party data)
- ❌ Not HIPAA compliant
- ❌ Generic e-commerce features

**Why Self-Hosted?**

- ✅ Full control over data
- ✅ $0 monthly cost
- ✅ HIPAA/LGPD compliant
- ✅ Healthcare-specific features
- ✅ Custom moderation
- ✅ Simple with shadcn/ui + React

**Implementation:** 4 weeks (Phase 1D)
