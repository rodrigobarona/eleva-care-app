## Terminology Standards

### ✅ Always Use These Terms

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `expert` / `care expert` | Healthcare professionals         | "Book a session with an expert"                       |
| `Experts on Eleva Care`  | Platform identity (Airbnb-style) | "Experts on Eleva Care are independent professionals" |
| `client`                 | Person booking appointments      | "Clients choose their own expert"                     |
| `trusted platform`       | What we are                      | "A trusted platform connecting you..."                |
| `Your expert`            | Personal, empowering             | "Your expert will provide personalized care"          |

### ❌ Never Use These Terms

| Avoid                     | Why                       | Use Instead              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `practitioner`            | Too clinical, formal      | `expert` / `care expert` |

## Airbnb-Style Platform Identity

### How We Mirror Airbnb's Approach

| Airbnb             | Eleva Care              | Why It Works             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| "Hosts on Airbnb"  | "Experts on Eleva Care" | Platform identity, trust |
| Hosts              | Experts                 | Service providers        |
| Guests             | Clients                 | Service seekers          |
| Superhosts         | Featured Experts        | Quality recognition      |
| "You're in charge" | "Your chosen expert"    | User empowerment         |

### Key Principle

Use "Experts on Eleva Care" consistently (like "Hosts on Airbnb"):

```tsx
// ✅ GOOD
<Text>Experts on Eleva Care are independent professionals who self-certify their credentials.</Text>

// ❌ BAD
<Text>Healthcare practitioners on our platform are independent contractors.</Text>
```

---

## Content Type Guidelines

### Marketing Content (Homepage, About, etc.)

**Tone:** Warm, inspiring, clear

```tsx
// ✅ GOOD
<h1>World-Class Women's Health Experts, on-demand.</h1>
<p>We connect you with independent, licensed care experts.</p>

// ❌ BAD
<h1>Access Licensed Healthcare Practitioners</h1>
<p>Our technology marketplace facilitates healthcare delivery.</p>
```

### UI Components & Messages

```tsx
// ✅ GOOD - Human-friendly
<Button>Find an Expert</Button>
<Text>Book your appointment</Text>
<Alert>Oops! Let's try that again.</Alert>

// ❌ BAD - Too formal
<Button>Initiate Scheduling Process</Button>
<Text>Schedule consultation</Text>
<Alert>Error: Operation failed</Alert>
```

### Email Content

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD
{
  subject: "Your Appointment is Confirmed!",
  body: "Great news! Your appointment with Dr. Santos is confirmed.",
  expert: "Your Expert: Dr. Maria Santos"
}

// ❌ BAD
{
  subject: "Appointment Confirmation Notification",
  body: "Your consultation has been successfully scheduled.",
  expert: "Healthcare Provider: Dr. Maria Santos"
}
```

### Legal Content (Terms, Privacy, etc.)

**Tone:** Clear, precise, but readable (not robotic)

```markdown
<!-- ✅ GOOD - Clear and human -->

## What we are (and aren't)

- We're a trusted platform that connects you with independent care experts
- We don't provide medical care—your expert does
- Your expert is responsible for your care

<!-- ❌ BAD - Too formal -->

## Platform Description

- This platform facilitates connections between users and healthcare practitioners
- The platform disclaims medical liability per statutory requirements
```

---

## Writing Rules

### Sentence Structure

**✅ DO:**

- Use short, clear sentences
- Active voice: "We connect you with experts"
- Conversational contractions: "We're", "You're"
- Personal pronouns: "you", "your", "we"

**❌ DON'T:**

- Long, passive sentences
- Formal language: "Appointments may be scheduled..."
- Third person: "Users may..."

### Word Choice Examples

```typescript
// ✅ DO: Human-friendly
"We're here to help";
'Your chosen expert';
'Find trusted experts';
'Book on your schedule';

// ❌ DON'T: Corporate jargon
'Our platform facilitates';
'Practitioners deliver';
'Access professionals';
'According to availability';
```

---

## Code Implementation Examples

### React Components

```tsx
// ✅ GOOD - Human-friendly messaging
export function ExpertCard({ expert }: Props) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Badge>Featured Expert</Badge>
      <Text>Experts on Eleva Care are independent professionals</Text>
      <Button>Book with {expert.name}</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}

// ❌ BAD - Formal, clinical
export function PractitionerCard({ practitioner }: Props) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Badge>Certified Healthcare Professional</Badge>
      <Text>Licensed practitioners self-certify credentials</Text>
      <Button>Schedule with {practitioner.name}</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Email Templates

```tsx
// ✅ GOOD
export function AppointmentConfirmation({ clientName, expertName }: Props) {
  return (
    <Email>
      <Heading>Your Appointment is Confirmed! ✅</Heading>
      <Text>Hi {clientName},</Text>
      <Text>Great news! Your appointment with {expertName} is confirmed.</Text>
      <Detail label="Your Expert">{expertName}</Detail>
      <Button>Join Video Call</Button>
    </Email>
  );
}

// ❌ BAD
export function AppointmentConfirmation({ clientName, practitionerName }: Props) {
  return (
    <Email>
      <Heading>Appointment Confirmation</Heading>
      <Text>Dear {clientName},</Text>
      <Text>Your consultation has been successfully scheduled.</Text>
      <Detail label="Healthcare Provider">{practitionerName}</Detail>
      <Button>Access Consultation</Button>
    </Email>
  );
}
```

### i18n Messages

```json
// ✅ GOOD - messages/en.json
{
  "hero": {
    "title": "World-Class Women's Health Experts, on-demand.",
    "subtitle": "Connect with independent, licensed care experts",
    "cta": "Find an Expert"
  },
  "platform": {
    "description": "Eleva Care is a trusted platform that connects you with independent care experts."
  }
}

// ❌ BAD
{
  "hero": {
    "title": "Access Healthcare Practitioners",
    "subtitle": "Technology marketplace for women's health services",
    "cta": "Search Providers"
  },
  "platform": {
    "description": "Our platform facilitates connections with healthcare professionals."
  }
}
```

---

## Multi-Language Guidelines

### Spanish (ES)

```json
// ✅ GOOD
{
  "description": "Eleva Care es una plataforma confiable que te conecta con especialistas independientes.",
  "expert": "Tu especialista",
  "disclaimer": "Los especialistas en Eleva Care son profesionales independientes."
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Use "especialista" (not "profesional de salud")
- Use "plataforma confiable" (not "marketplace tecnológico")
- Maintain formal "usted" for healthcare appropriateness

### Portuguese (PT/BR)

```json
// ✅ GOOD
{
  "description": "A Eleva Care é uma plataforma confiável que liga você a especialistas independentes.",

}
```

**Key Points:**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Reverting to Clinical Language

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG
<Text>Healthcare practitioners provide clinical interventions</Text>

// ✅ CORRECT
<Text>Your expert provides personalized care</Text>
```

### 2. Corporate Jargon

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG
<Heading>Our Organization Facilitates Healthcare Delivery</Heading>

// ✅ CORRECT
<Heading>We Connect You With Expert Care</Heading>
```

### 3. Passive Voice

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG
<Button>Appointments can be scheduled</Button>

// ✅ CORRECT
<Button>Book your appointment</Button>
```

### 4. Vague Roles

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG - Unclear who provides care
<Text>We provide healthcare services</Text>

// ✅ CORRECT - Clear role definition
<Text>We connect you with experts. Your chosen expert provides your care.</Text>
```

## Before & After Examples

### Platform Description

**❌ Before** (Too corporate):

> "Eleva Care is a technology marketplace that connects you with independent, licensed healthcare practitioners for women's health services."

**✅ After** (Human-friendly):

> "Eleva Care is a trusted platform that connects you with independent, licensed care experts. We provide the technology; your chosen expert provides your care."

**Why it works:**

- "Trusted" > "technology" (emotion vs feature)
- "Care experts" > "practitioners" (human vs clinical)
- "Your chosen expert" (empowerment)
- Clear role separation

### Expert Disclaimer

**❌ Before** (Formal):

> "Healthcare practitioners utilizing this platform are independent contractors who self-certify their professional credentials."

**✅ After** (Airbnb-style):

> "Experts on Eleva Care are independent professionals who self-certify their credentials."

**Why it works:**

- "Experts on Eleva Care" (platform identity like Airbnb)
- Simpler, clearer language
- More human, less legal

│  ├─ Is it legal content?
│  │  └─ Use clear, precise, but readable tone
│  ├─ Is it transactional (email)?
│  │  └─ Use friendly, helpful, clear tone

```

## Pro Tips

1. **Think Airbnb**: How would Airbnb say this about hosts and guests?
2. **Read aloud**: Does it sound like a human talking?
3. **Empathy check**: Does it make the user feel supported?
4. **Role clarity**: Is it clear who does what (platform vs expert)?
5. **Simplicity**: Could you explain this to a friend?
