# Instructions to all user request

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the [.scratchpad](mdc:.scratchpad) file  so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the [.scratchpad](mdc:.scratchpad) file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Lint all code and run pnpm build to ensure its working before finish the tasks
Use model o3-mini of your available llm to planeer the tasks
Take attention to Additional Lessons Learned sections in [.scratchpad](mdc:.scratchpad) to avoid same errors
