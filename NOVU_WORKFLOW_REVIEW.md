## ⚠️ Remaining Minor Issues

### **Empty Placeholder Workflows (Low Priority)**

These workflows exist but have no steps. They can be implemented as needed:

- `appointment-universal`: For general appointment notifications
- `security-auth`: For security-related notifications
- `system-health`: For system status notifications
- `marketplace-universal`: For marketplace-related notifications

**Recommendation**: Implement these workflows as specific use cases arise.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Test Workflows**: Trigger test notifications to verify functionality
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track delivery rates and user engagement
3. **Implement Remaining**: Add steps to empty workflows as needed
4. **User Preferences**: Fine-tune channel preferences based on user feedback
