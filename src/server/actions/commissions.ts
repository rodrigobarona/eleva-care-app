/**
 * Commission Tracking Server Actions
 *
 * Records and tracks commission transactions for all expert bookings.
 * Integrates with subscription system to apply correct commission rates.
 *
 * 💰 COMMISSION RATE DETERMINATION:
 *
 * Solo Experts (type: 'expert_individual'):
 * ----------------------------------------
 * Commission rate = f(Expert Role, Subscription Plan)
 *
 * Community Expert (role: 'expert_community'):
 *   • Commission-only plan → 20%
 *   • Monthly subscription → 12% (saves 40%)
 *   • Annual subscription → 12% (saves 40%)
 *
 * Top Expert (role: 'expert_top'):
 *   • Commission-only plan → 15%
 *   • Monthly subscription → 8% (saves 47%)
 *   • Annual subscription → 8% (saves 47%)
 *
 * Clinics (type: 'clinic') - Future:
 * ----------------------------------
 * Each expert in the clinic keeps their INDIVIDUAL commission rate
 * based on their own role, regardless of the clinic's subscription.
 *
 * Example:
 *   Clinic subscribes to workspace plan ($99/month)
 *   ├─ Dr. Maria (expert_top) → 8% commission on her bookings
 *   ├─ Dr. João (expert_community) → 12% on his bookings
 *   └─ Commission per expert ensures fair compensation
 *
 * 🎯 WHY PER-EXPERT RATES IN CLINICS?
 * - Fair compensation (top experts earned their lower rates)
 * - Talent retention (experts keep benefits when joining clinics)
 * - Growth incentive (community → top progression)
 * - Industry standard (Cal.com, Vercel use similar models)
 *
 * 📊 CALCULATION LOGIC:
 * 1. Patient books appointment → Payment succeeds
 * 2. recordCommission() called with booking details
 * 3. Lookup expert's role from UsersTable
 * 4. Lookup org subscription from SubscriptionPlansTable
 * 5. Determine commission rate based on role + plan type
 * 6. Calculate: commission = bookingAmount × rate
 * 7. Record transaction with metadata (tierLevel, planType)
 * 8. Expert receives: bookingAmount - commission
 *
 * Used by:
 * - Stripe webhook (when payment_intent.succeeded)
 * - Financial reporting and analytics
 * - Eligibility calculations for subscription upgrades
