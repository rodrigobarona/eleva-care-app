/**
 * Eleva Subscription Pricing Configuration
 *
 * Defines pricing tiers, commission rates, and eligibility criteria
 * for the Eleva expert platform pricing model.
 *
 * 🏗️ BUSINESS MODEL ARCHITECTURE:
 *
 * 1️⃣ SOLO EXPERTS (Current - Phase 1):
 *    Each expert has their own organization (type: 'expert_individual')
 *    with a subscription that matches their expert level.
 *
 *    Community Expert:
 *      • Commission-only: 20% per booking
 *      • Monthly ($49/mo): 12% commission (40% savings)
 *      • Annual ($490/yr): 12% commission (40% savings)
 *
 *    Top Expert:
 *      • Commission-only: 15% per booking
 *      • Monthly ($177/mo): 8% commission (47% savings)
 *      • Annual ($1,774/yr): 8% commission (47% savings)
 *
 * 2️⃣ TEAMS (Future - Phase 2):
 *    Multi-expert organizations (type: 'team') where each expert
 *    maintains their individual commission rate based on their role.
 *
 *    Example:
 *      Team Organization ($99/month team fee)
 *        ├─ Dr. Maria (expert_top) → 8% commission on her bookings
 *        ├─ Dr. João (expert_community) → 12% on his bookings
 *        └─ Dr. Ana (expert_community) → 12% on her bookings
 *
 *    💡 Per-expert rates ensure:
 *       - Fair compensation (top experts earned their benefits)
 *       - Talent retention (experts keep benefits in teams)
 *       - Growth incentive (community → top progression)
 *
 * 🎯 COMMISSION CALCULATION:
 *    Commission Rate = f(Expert Role, Plan Type)
 *    Always based on the INDIVIDUAL expert's role, never the org subscription.
