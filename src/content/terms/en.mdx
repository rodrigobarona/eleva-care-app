# Terms of Service

_Effective Date:_ April 16, 2025

Welcome to **Eleva.care** (operated by **Búzios e Tartarugas, Lda.**). By using Eleva.care, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.

## Definitions

- **Platform** means the Eleva.care digital health platform, including websites, applications, and related infrastructure operated by Eleva.care.
- **Expert** means an independent, duly licensed healthcare professional who offers remote healthcare services through the Platform.
- **Teleconsultation** means the remote provision of healthcare services by an Expert to a client through the Eleva.care platform, using digital communication tools.
- **Clinical Care** means diagnosis, treatment, or other healthcare services provided by an Expert to a client.

## 1) What Eleva.care is (and isn't)

- Eleva.care is a digital health platform that enables the delivery of remote healthcare services (teleconsultations / telemedicine) by independent, licensed professionals.
- Eleva.care does not provide clinical care or medical treatment. We do not employ experts and do not interfere with or supervise their clinical judgment.
- Experts on Eleva.care are independent, licensed in their jurisdictions, hold their own professional liability insurance, and are solely responsible for clinical decisions and patient outcomes.
- Eleva.care assumes organizational, technical, and administrative responsibility for operating the digital health platform, in accordance with applicable Portuguese and EU regulations.

## 2) What we provide

- Accounts, identity verification, and support
- For clients: search and discovery, booking and scheduling, payments (via Stripe), secure messaging, and your appointment history
- For experts: profile management, scheduling, encrypted notes (you control the content), payments and payouts (via Stripe Connect), secure client messaging, and encrypted file storage
- Eleva.care does not provide medical services. Experts self‑declare their credentials and professional status; Eleva.care may request documentation and perform reasonable checks where required for platform integrity, regulatory compliance, or risk management.

Our features may change over time.

## 3) Accounts and eligibility

- You must be 18+ and able to enter a contract
- Provide accurate information, keep your credentials secure, and tell us if there’s unauthorized use of your account

## 4) Using Eleva.care

Use Eleva.care lawfully and respectfully. Don’t:

- Break the law or others’ rights
- Commit fraud or mislead others
- Post harmful, illegal, or defamatory content
- Interfere with the platform’s normal operation
- Claim to be a licensed professional if you’re not
- Use Eleva.care for emergencies

We may suspend or terminate access if these rules are violated.

## 5) Clients

- You choose your expert and should check their credentials and licensing
- The healthcare relationship is established directly between you and the selected Expert. Eleva.care facilitates scheduling, payment, and technical access to the remote consultation but does not itself enter into a healthcare provider–patient relationship with you.
- Eleva.care is not responsible for clinical decisions or medical outcomes arising from the care provided by experts.

## 6) Experts

By using Eleva.care, you represent and warrant that you:

- Are duly licensed and in good standing
- Maintain professional liability insurance
- Are solely responsible for the care you provide and for obtaining informed consent
- Comply with all applicable healthcare laws and regulations
- Operate as an independent contractor, not an employee of Eleva.care

## 7) Payments and fees

- Prices and fees are shown before you pay; payments are processed by Stripe
- Unless the law requires otherwise, fees are generally non‑refundable
- If there’s a payment issue, we’ll help you resolve it

See our [Payment Policies](/legal/payment-policies#9-chargebacks-and-disputes) for details on chargebacks, PSD2/3DS, failed payments, and refunds.

## 8) Privacy

Your use is governed by our Privacy Policy. We process personal data in line with applicable law, including the GDPR where relevant.

## 9) Intellectual property

The Eleva.care platform, including text, graphics, logos, and software, is owned by Eleva.care or our licensors. Please don’t copy, use, or distribute our materials without permission.

## 10) Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

- Eleva.care is responsible for the operation, security, and regulatory compliance of the digital health platform. Eleva.care assumes organizational, technical, and administrative responsibility for the platform in accordance with applicable Portuguese and EU regulations.
- Eleva.care is not responsible for clinical decisions, medical outcomes, or disputes between you and an expert arising from the clinical care provided.
- Eleva.care maintains internal procedures for platform security, incident response, and risk management related to the operation of the digital health platform.

### Emergencies

Eleva.care is not for emergencies. If you need urgent help, call your local emergency number (EU: 112, US: 911) immediately.

## 11) Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold Eleva.care harmless from claims and costs arising from your misuse of the platform, violation of these Terms, or infringement of others’ rights.

## 12) Ending or suspending service

We may suspend or terminate access if Terms are violated or to protect our community. You can close your account anytime by contacting support. Any amounts owed remain due.

## 13) Governing law

These Terms are governed by Portuguese law. Courts in Portugal have jurisdiction over disputes related to these Terms or your use of Eleva.care.

## 14) Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms. We’ll notify you of material changes; continuing to use Eleva.care means you accept the updated Terms.

## 15) EU consumer information

- Your statutory consumer rights aren’t affected. You can use the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution platform: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr
- Right of withdrawal: Where applicable to certain non‑healthcare platform services, you may withdraw within 14 days unless you request immediate performance. For time‑specific healthcare services performed by independent experts, withdrawal may not apply once the service begins or for services scheduled for a specific date/time, as allowed by law.
