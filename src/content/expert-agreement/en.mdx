# Expert Service Agreement

_Effective Date: December 31, 2025_

Welcome to Eleva.care. This agreement explains, in plain language, how we work together when you offer services on our platform.

Eleva.care operates a digital health platform that enables the delivery of remote healthcare services by independent, licensed professionals and functions within the framework of digital health and telemedicine activities as defined under applicable Portuguese law, without itself providing clinical care.

## 1) Your status (independent professional)

- You are an independent, licensed care professional—not our employee, partner, or agent.
- You run your own professional practice and remain responsible for your clinical decisions, professional licensing, insurance, taxes, and compliance with clinical and ethical obligations. Eleva.care remains responsible for the organizational, technical, and administrative compliance of the digital health platform it operates.
- Eleva.care does not interfere with or influence the clinical judgment, diagnosis, or treatment decisions of experts.

## 2) Professional requirements

- Keep your license(s) valid and in good standing; tell us if anything changes.
- Experts remain solely responsible for maintaining valid professional registration, licensing, and authorization to provide healthcare services under applicable law.
- Maintain professional liability (malpractice) insurance (keep proof available).
- Provide care consistent with law, ethics, informed consent, and clinical standards; keep accurate records and protect privacy.

## 3) Data roles (GDPR/LGPD)

- For clinical notes/files you create, you are the Data Controller; Eleva.care is your Data Processor
- We store data securely and act only on your documented instructions; we provide encryption, access controls, audit, and breach notice
- You handle patient notices/consents, data subject requests, and retention rules for medical records
- See our [Data Processing Agreement](/trust/dpa) and [Security](/trust/security) pages for subprocessors and safeguards

## 4) Platform services (what we provide)

- Profile, availability, booking and scheduling tools
- Encrypted storage for your notes/files (you control content)
- Payments via Stripe Connect; patient messaging and notifications
- Technical support, plus GDPR assistance (when appropriate)

We do not provide medical advice or supervision, provide malpractice insurance, referrals, or billing/coding services. Experts self‑declare their credentials and professional status; Eleva.care may request documentation and perform reasonable checks where required for platform integrity, regulatory compliance, or risk management.

## 5) Pricing, fees, and payouts

- You set your prices
- For each completed appointment: 85% to you, 15% platform fee (covers Stripe fees and platform costs)
- Payouts run through Stripe Connect, timing per your settings and bank rules
- You handle your taxes (income, VAT if applicable, social contributions). We provide transaction history and annual earnings summary

## 6) Patient relationship and care standards

- Your relationship is directly with the patient; obtain informed consent and maintain confidentiality
- The platform is not for emergencies; communicate appropriate emergency guidance (EU: 112, US: 911)
- Follow telehealth rules where relevant (licensing, location checks, standard of care)

## 7) Prohibited behavior

- Don’t misrepresent credentials, practice beyond your scope, violate privacy, engage in misconduct/illegal activity, bypass platform payments, or solicit off‑platform to avoid fees
- Violations may lead to suspension or termination

## 8) Term and termination

- Starts when your expert account is created and continues until either of us ends it
- You can close your account; complete/cancel booked visits and meet record‑keeping duties
- We may suspend/terminate for license issues, fraud/illegality, serious misconduct, or policy breaches
- Upon termination, we provide an export of your data; you remain responsible for legally required retention

## 9) Liability

- You are solely responsible for the clinical care you provide, clinical decisions, patient outcomes, and for maintaining required insurance.
- Eleva.care is responsible for the operation, security, and regulatory compliance of the digital health platform. Eleva.care assumes organizational, technical, and administrative responsibility for the platform in accordance with applicable Portuguese and EU regulations, while Experts remain solely responsible for clinical decisions and outcomes.
- You agree to indemnify Eleva.care for claims arising from your medical practice, regulatory breaches, or violations of this agreement.

## 10) IP, confidentiality, and notices

- Eleva.care owns the platform; you own your clinical notes, profile, and materials
- You grant us permission to display your profile and store/backup your data; we may use aggregated, anonymized data to improve the platform
- Keep business/technical information confidential; follow healthcare privacy laws for patient data
- Notices: support@eleva.care (legal: legal@eleva.care, DPO: dpo@eleva.care)

## 11) Updates, law, and disputes

- We may update this agreement; we’ll provide notice and request acceptance for material changes
- Governing law: Portugal. Disputes: good‑faith negotiation → mediation → courts of Portugal

In case of divergence between language versions, the Portuguese version shall prevail.

By offering services on Eleva.care, you confirm you are licensed, insured, and agree to these terms as an independent professional.
