We respect your privacy and keep things simple. This page explains what we collect, why, how we protect it, and your choices.

## 1) Who we are and our role

- Eleva.care is a digital health platform that enables the delivery of remote healthcare services by independent, licensed care experts. Eleva.care does not provide clinical care; healthcare services are delivered by independent experts through the platform.
- We act as:
  - Data Controller for platform operations (accounts, bookings, payments, support, analytics)
  - Data Processor for clinical notes and files created by experts (they are the Controller; we provide secure storage)

## 2) What we collect

- Account data: name, email, phone
- Booking data: schedules, history, messages
- Payment data: processed by Stripe (we don’t store card data)
- Usage data: device, IP, logs, analytics
- Clinical data (when used): expert‑created notes/files stored encrypted (expert controls content)

Cookies help essential features work and help us understand usage. You can manage cookies in your browser; some features may not work without them.

## 3) Why we use data

- Provide and improve the platform
- Bookings, payments, and support
- Security, fraud prevention, and compliance
- Communications you request or opt into
- Legal obligations

Legal bases include contract performance, legitimate interests (security, product improvement), consent (where required), and legal compliance. For clinical data, experts rely on healthcare bases (e.g., GDPR Art. 9(2)(h)); storage may also rely on your explicit consent.

## 4) Sharing

- With processors who help us run the service (e.g., Stripe, WorkOS, Vercel, Neon, Novu, PostHog, Resend, Upstash). They act under contract and can't use data for their own purposes.
- If required by law or to protect rights and safety
- As part of a corporate transaction, with notice

See our [Data Processing Agreement](/trust/dpa) for the current subprocessor list and safeguards.

## 5) Retention (how long we keep data)

- Account data: while your account is active; if inactive, we notify after 12 months, then delete within 24 months
- Bookings metadata and support: about 24 months after last activity
- Payments/invoices: up to 10 years (legal)
- Analytics: up to 12 months (then aggregated/anonymized)
- Security audit logs: at least 12 months
- Backups: about 30 days (encrypted)
- Clinical data: kept per expert instructions and applicable healthcare laws

## 6) Your rights

Under GDPR/LGPD you can request: access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, and to object. If we rely on consent, you can withdraw it. You can also complain to your authority (e.g., CNPD in Portugal).

How to exercise your rights: email `privacy@eleva.care` or `dpo@eleva.care`. We respond within 1 month under GDPR (can extend for complex requests) and 15 days under LGPD.

## 7) Security

We protect data with encryption in transit and at rest, least‑privilege access, auditing, and continuous monitoring. No system is 100% secure, but we work hard to keep your data safe. See our [Security](/trust/security) page for details.

## 8) International transfers

We primarily host data in the EU. When data moves, we use legal safeguards (e.g., SCCs, TIAs, supplementary measures) consistent with GDPR and LGPD.

## 9) Children

Our services are not for children under 16. For Brazil, minors are under 18; we process minors’ data only with a parent/guardian’s consent and participation (LGPD Art. 14).

## 10) Government requests

We require valid legal process, narrow the scope to what’s necessary, challenge overbroad/unlawful requests, and provide user notice where permitted.

## 11) Changes

We’ll update this policy as needed and note the effective date. If changes are material, we’ll let you know.
