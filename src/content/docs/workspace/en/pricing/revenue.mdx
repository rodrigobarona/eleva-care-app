# Revenue Sharing Model

Eleva Care uses a transparent three-party revenue model that ensures fair compensation for everyone involved—patients, experts, organizations, and the platform.

## How It Works

When a patient books an appointment through your organization:

```
Patient pays $100 for consultation
         ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│        REVENUE DISTRIBUTION        │
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Eleva Platform Fee    8-20%        │
│ Your Organization Fee 10-25%       │
│ Expert Payment        60-82%       │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Setting Your Marketing Fee

### Factors to Consider

2. **Market Rates**
   - Traditional practices take 30-50%
   - Your digital advantage: 10-25%
   - Competitive but fair

3. **Expert Retention**
   - Too high: Experts may leave
   - Too low: Unsustainable for you
   - Sweet spot: 15-20%

### Fee Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pricing**
2. Enter your marketing fee percentage (10-25%)
3. System validates against expert minimums

Action: Please set a fee between 10-25%
```

If combined fees would exceed 40%:

```
Error: Combined fees (35% organization + 12% platform = 47%) 
       would exceed maximum 40% for Community Expert.
Action: Reduce organization fee or wait for expert tier upgrade.
```
