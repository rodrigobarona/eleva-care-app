## Best Practices

### Personalize Your Invitations

Instead of generic invitations:

```
❌ "Join our organization on Eleva Care"

✅ "Hi Dr. Maria! I've been impressed by your work in women's health. 
We'd love to have you join our team. Our patients would 
benefit greatly from your expertise in prenatal care."
```

### Set Clear Expectations

Before inviting, communicate:

- Your patient volume and acquisition strategy
- Support you'll provide (marketing, admin, etc.)
- Your marketing fee and justification
- How you'll help them succeed

### Follow Up

After sending invitations:

- Wait 3-5 days before following up
- Send a personal email or call
- Offer to answer questions
- Don't pressure—let them decide
