# Welcome to Workspace Portal

Eleva Care empowers healthcare organizations—clinics, wellness centers, employers, and health institutions—to deliver digital health services through our proven platform technology. This resource center will help you set up and manage your workspace effectively.

## What is a Workspace?

A **workspace** is your dedicated space on Eleva Care where you manage your healthcare practice:

- **Dr. Patricia's Workspace** - A solo practitioner's online practice
- **Wellness Center Workspace** - A wellness center's digital health services
- **Corporate Health Workspace** - An employer's employee wellness program

Whether you're running a physical clinic, an online practice, or a hybrid model, your workspace is where it all comes together.
