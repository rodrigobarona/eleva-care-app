# Managing Availability

Your availability determines when patients can book appointments. Set up your schedule to balance patient access with your work-life needs.

## Availability Settings

### Weekly Schedule

Define your recurring weekly availability:

1. Go to **Expert Dashboard** > **Availability**
2. Click on each day to add time slots
3. Set start and end times
4. Save your schedule

**Example Schedule:**

| Day | Availability |
|-----|--------------|
| Monday | 9:00 - 13:00, 14:00 - 18:00 |
| Tuesday | 9:00 - 13:00 |
| Wednesday | 14:00 - 20:00 |
| Thursday | 9:00 - 13:00, 14:00 - 18:00 |
| Friday | 9:00 - 12:00 |
| Saturday | Unavailable |
| Sunday | Unavailable |

### Time Zone

Your timezone is crucial for international patients:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Time Zone**
2. Select your timezone
3. All availability displays in this timezone
4. Patients see times in their local timezone

<Callout type="info">
  Patients always see appointment times in their local timezone, but your dashboard shows your timezone.
</Callout>

## Calendar Integration

### Google Calendar Sync

Connect your Google Calendar for two-way sync:

1. Go to **Integrations** > **Google Calendar**
2. Click **Connect**
3. Authorize Eleva Care access
4. Select calendars to sync

**Benefits:**
- Automatic blocking of existing events
- Appointments appear in your Google Calendar
- Prevents double-booking
- Real-time updates

### How Sync Works

| Direction | What Syncs |
|-----------|------------|
| Google → Eleva | Events block your availability |
| Eleva → Google | New bookings appear in your calendar |

<Callout type="warning">
  **Privacy Note**: We only read event times and free/busy status. We don't access event details or attendees from your personal calendar.
</Callout>

## Appointment Settings

### Minimum Notice

Set how far in advance patients must book:

|---------|----------|
| 1 hour | Maximum flexibility, last-minute bookings |
| 24 hours | Standard - time to prepare |
| 48 hours | More preparation time |
| 1 week | Complex consultations |
