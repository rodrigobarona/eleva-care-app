# Top Expert Requirements

Top Expert status is earned through consistent excellence. Like Airbnb's Superhost program, it recognizes professionals who deliver exceptional patient experiences.

## Overview

Top Expert is not purchased—it's earned through:

- High patient satisfaction
- Consistent availability
- Reliable service delivery
- Professional communication

## Qualification Criteria

You must meet **all** of the following criteria:

### 1. Rating Requirement

**Minimum 4.8 out of 5.0 stars average rating**

- Calculated from all reviews in evaluation period
- Responses to reviews don't affect rating
- All reviews are weighted equally

### 2. Appointment Volume

**Minimum 25 completed appointments** in the past 90 days

- Cancelled appointments don't count
- Patient no-shows count as completed
- Both new and follow-up appointments count

### 3. Cancellation Rate

**Less than 5% cancellation rate**

- Measured over past 90 days
- Only expert-initiated cancellations count
- Patient cancellations don't affect your rate

Calculation:
```
Cancellation Rate = Expert Cancellations / Total Bookings × 100
```

### 4. Response Rate

**90% or higher response rate** within 24 hours

- Respond to booking inquiries
- Answer patient messages
- Acknowledge appointment confirmations

### 5. Experience Requirement

**Minimum 3 months** as an active Community Expert

- Profile must be published
- Active means accepting bookings
- Breaks don't reset the clock

### 6. Availability Consistency

**Active 80% or more** of days in evaluation period

- Days with available time slots
- Doesn't require bookings each day
- Vacation blocks don't penalize you (if marked in advance)
