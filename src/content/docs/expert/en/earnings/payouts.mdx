# Payouts & Earnings

Eleva Care uses Stripe Connect for secure, automated payouts. This guide explains how earnings work and how to maximize your income.

## How Payments Work

### Payment Flow

1. **Patient Books** - Payment is collected at booking
2. **Funds Held** - Payment held in escrow during consultation
3. **Appointment Completes** - Funds released 24 hours after
4. **Payout Processed** - Funds transferred to your bank account

```
Patient Pays → Escrow Hold → Consultation → 24hr Hold → Your Bank
```

<Callout type="info">
  The 24-hour hold after consultation allows for any disputes or issues to be resolved.
</Callout>

## Platform Fees

### Fee Structure

Your platform fee depends on your tier and subscription plan:

| Tier | Plan | Commission | Monthly Fee |
|------|------|------------|-------------|
| Community | Commission-Only | 20% | €0 |
| Community | Subscription | 12% | €49/month or €490/year |
| Top Expert | Commission-Only | 15% | €0 |
| Top Expert | Subscription | 8% | €177/month or €1,774/year |

### Choosing Your Plan

**Commission-Only** is better if:
- You're just starting out
- You have fewer than 10 bookings/month
- You prefer no fixed costs

**Subscription** is better if:
- You have consistent bookings
- You want to maximize earnings per appointment
- You want predictable costs

### Example Calculations

**€100 Consultation - Community Expert:**

| Plan | Commission | You Receive |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Commission-Only (20%) | €20 | €80 |
| Subscription (12%) | €12 | €88 |

**Break-even Point**: With the €49/month subscription, you save €8 per booking. You break even at ~6 bookings/month.
