# Pricing Strategy

Setting the right price is crucial for building a successful practice on Eleva Care. This guide helps you develop a pricing strategy that works.

## Pricing Principles

### Value-Based Pricing

Price based on the value you provide, not just time spent:

- Your expertise and credentials
- Patient outcomes
- Specialized training
- Years of experience

### Market Positioning

Consider where you want to position yourself:

| Position | Characteristics | Price Range |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Premium** | Extensive experience, specialized credentials | €120-200+ |
| **Mid-Range** | Solid experience, good reviews | €80-120 |
| **Entry** | Building experience, growing patient base | €50-80 |

## Factors Affecting Price

### Your Credentials

Higher credentials justify higher prices:

- Advanced degrees (PhD, Masters)
- Specialized certifications
- Published research
- Speaking engagements

### Experience Level

| Experience | Typical Premium |
|------------|-----------------|
| 0-2 years | Base rate |
| 3-5 years | +10-20% |
| 6-10 years | +20-35% |
| 10+ years | +35-50%+ |

### Specialization

Specialized services often command higher prices:

- Rare expertise
- Complex conditions
- Innovative techniques
- Exclusive training

### Market Demand

Adjust based on:

- Your booking rate
- Waitlist length
- Competitor pricing
- Seasonal patterns

## Pricing by Service Type

- Comprehensive assessment

- Extended time

**Typical Range**: €80-150 for 60 minutes

## Pricing Strategies

## Calculating Your Rate

### Step 1: Determine Target Income

Consider:

- Desired monthly/annual income
- Number of hours you want to work
- Business expenses
- Taxes

### Step 2: Factor in Platform Fees

Remember to account for Eleva Care fees:

| Your Price | Commission (12%) | You Receive |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| €80 | €9.60 | €70.40 |
| €100 | €12.00 | €88.00 |
| €120 | €14.40 | €105.60 |

### Step 3: Calculate Hourly Equivalent

Include time for:

- The consultation itself
- Preparation
- Notes and documentation
- Admin tasks

**Example**: 60-min consultation + 30 min prep/notes = 90 min total work time

If you charge €120 and work 90 minutes, your effective rate is €80/hour (minus fees).

## Adjusting Your Prices

### When to Raise Prices

- Consistently booked out
- Long waitlist
- Gained new credentials
- Positive review growth
- After 6-12 months of experience

### How to Raise Prices

1. Give advance notice to existing patients
2. Update service prices
3. Consider grandfathering existing patients briefly
4. Communicate value, not just price

### When to Lower Prices

- Low booking rate
- New to the platform
- Entering a competitive niche
- Building your patient base

## Competitor Research

### How to Research

1. Browse expert profiles in your specialty
2. Note their credentials and prices
3. Compare experience levels
4. Consider their review ratings

### What to Compare

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Same specialty | High |
| Similar experience | High |
| Same region/language | Medium |
| Similar credentials | Medium |

## Common Mistakes

### Pricing Too Low

- Few bookings to build reviews
- Harder to establish presence
- May need to lower (looks bad)

### Ignoring Fees

- Price €100, think you'll earn €100

- End up with lower effective rate

### One-Size-Fits-All

- Same price for all services
- Missing opportunity for premium offerings
- Not serving different needs

## Testing Your Pricing
