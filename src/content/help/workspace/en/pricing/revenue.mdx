# Revenue Sharing Model

Eleva Care uses a transparent three-party revenue model that ensures fair compensation for everyone involved—patients, experts, workspaces, and the platform.

## How It Works

When a patient books an appointment through your workspace:

```
Patient pays $100 for consultation
         ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│        REVENUE DISTRIBUTION        │
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Eleva Platform Fee    8-20%        │
│ Your Workspace Fee    10-25%       │
│ Expert Payment        60-82%       │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Revenue Split Breakdown

| Top | Commission-only | 15% |
| Top | Monthly/Annual | 8% |

**Covers**: Technology platform, payment processing, video infrastructure, support

### 2. Workspace Marketing Fee (10-25%)

### 3. Expert Payment (60-82%)

## Setting Your Marketing Fee

### Factors to Consider

1. **Value You Provide**
   - Patient acquisition costs
   - Marketing spend
   - Administrative support
   - Brand value

2. **Market Rates**
   - Traditional practices take 30-50%
   - Your digital advantage: 10-25%
   - Competitive but fair

3. **Expert Retention**
   - Too high: Experts may leave
   - Too low: Unsustainable for you
   - Sweet spot: 15-20%

### Fee Configuration

To set your marketing fee:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pricing**
2. Enter your marketing fee percentage (10-25%)
3. System validates against expert minimums
4. Save changes

<Callout type="warning">
  **Fee Changes**: Existing experts must be notified 30 days before any fee increase. Decreases take effect immediately.

## Protection Rules

### Validation Example

If you try to set a 30% marketing fee:

```
Error: Workspace fee (30%) would exceed maximum (25%)
Action: Please set a fee between 10-25%
```

If combined fees would exceed 40%:

```
Error: Combined fees (25% workspace + 20% platform = 45%) 
       would exceed maximum 40% for Community Expert.
Action: Reduce workspace fee to 20% or wait for expert tier upgrade.
```
