# Welcome to Workspace Portal

Eleva Care empowers healthcare organizations—clinics, wellness centers, employers, and health institutions—to deliver digital health services through our proven platform technology.

## What is a Workspace?

A **workspace** is your dedicated space on Eleva Care where you manage your healthcare practice:

- **Dr. Patricia's Workspace** - A solo practitioner's online practice
- **Wellness Center Workspace** - A wellness center's digital health services
- **Corporate Health Workspace** - An employer's employee wellness program

Whether you're running a physical clinic, an online practice, or a hybrid model, your workspace is where it all comes together.
