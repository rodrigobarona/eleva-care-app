## Calendar Integration

### Google Calendar Sync

Connect your Google Calendar for two-way sync:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Connect

    Go to **Integrations** → **Google Calendar** and click **Connect**.

### How Sync Works

| Direction      | What Syncs                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Google → Eleva | Events block your availability automatically |
| Eleva → Google | New bookings appear in your calendar         |

<Callout type="info">
  **Privacy Note**: We only read event times and free/busy status. We don't access event details or
  attendees from your personal calendar.
</Callout>

## Appointment Settings

<Tabs items={['Minimum Notice', 'Buffer Time', 'Advance Booking']}>
  <Tab value="Minimum Notice">
    **How far in advance must patients book?**

    | Setting | Use Case |
    |---------|----------|
    | 1 hour | Maximum flexibility, last-minute bookings |
    | 24 hours | Standard — time to prepare |
    | 48 hours | More preparation time |
    | 1 week | Complex consultations |

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Buffer Time">
    **Add time between appointments:**
