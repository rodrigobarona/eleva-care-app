  <Tab value="Introductory">
    **Introductory Pricing**

    Attract new patients:

    - Limited-time lower rates
    - First consultation discount

  </Tab>

<Callout type="info">

</Callout>

## Calculating Your Rate

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Determine Target Income

    Consider your desired monthly/annual income, hours you want to work, business expenses, and taxes.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Factor in Platform Fees

    | Your Price | Commission (12%) | You Receive |
    |------------|------------------|-------------|
    | €80 | €9.60 | €70.40 |
    | €100 | €12.00 | €88.00 |
    | €120 | €14.40 | €105.60 |
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Calculate Hourly Equivalent

    Include time for the consultation itself, preparation, notes and documentation, and admin tasks.

    **Example**: 60-min consultation + 30 min prep/notes = 90 min total work time

    If you charge €120 and work 90 minutes, your effective rate is €80/hour (minus fees).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adjusting Your Prices

<Tabs items={['When to Raise', 'When to Lower']}>
  <Tab value="When to Raise">
    **Raise Prices When:**

    - Consistently booked out
    - Long waitlist
    - Gained new credentials

    - After 6-12 months of experience

    **How to Raise:**
    1. Give advance notice to existing patients
    2. Update service prices
    3. Consider grandfathering existing patients briefly
    4. Communicate value, not just price
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="When to Lower">
    **Lower Prices When:**

| Same region/language | Medium |
| Similar credentials | Medium |
