/>

<TextBlock>
  Eleva Care was created to make expert women’s health physiotherapy easier to access—without losing
  scientific rigor. Our founder, Patricia Mota, PT, PhD, is an internationally cited researcher in
  pelvic floor and abdominal wall function during pregnancy and postpartum. Together with our
  advisors, she helps ensure that the care you receive via telehealth reflects the best available
  science.
</TextBlock>

<TextBlock>
  When we design a telehealth pathway—whether for diastasis recti, pelvic floor dysfunction or
  pregnancy-related pain—we begin from clinical guidelines and key trials. We ask: what parts of
  assessment and treatment can safely and effectively be delivered by secure video, what needs
  in-person examination, and how can we monitor progress over time?
</TextBlock>

<TextBlock>
  Our team regularly reviews new publications in telehealth, physiotherapy and women’s health. As
  evidence evolves, we update our protocols, education materials and safety criteria—so that your
  care remains aligned with current research rather than static routines.

      id: 'faq-1',
      question: 'Can a telehealth physiotherapy session be as effective as in-person care?',
      answer:
        'For many musculoskeletal and pelvic health problems, studies show that structured tele-physiotherapy can lead to improvements in pain, function and quality of life comparable to traditional in-person care—especially when exercise, education and self-management are central. Some assessments and treatments (for example, certain manual tests or procedures) still require in-person visits. Your clinician will explain what can safely be done remotely and when they recommend in-person assessment.',
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-2',
      question: 'Is telehealth physiotherapy safe during pregnancy and after birth?',
      answer:
        'Guidelines from organizations such as ACOG support regular, individualized physical activity and pelvic floor training during pregnancy and postpartum for most women. When care is provided by a licensed physiotherapist who understands obstetric red flags, telehealth can be a safe way to deliver education and exercise, coordinate with your obstetric provider, and adjust your plan as pregnancy or recovery progresses. If concerning symptoms appear, your clinician will recommend in-person or urgent care.',
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-3',
      question: 'How can you assess my pelvic floor or abdominal wall over video?',
      answer:
        'While telehealth cannot replace every in-person test, much of a pelvic floor or abdominal wall assessment comes from a detailed history, observation of posture and movement, and guided self-palpation or functional tests. Your physiotherapist may ask you to feel specific areas, perform breathing and activation tasks, and describe sensations. When an internal exam, ultrasound or imaging is necessary, they will coordinate or refer you for in-person assessment.',
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-4',
      question: 'Who is responsible for my care—Eleva Care or the clinician I choose?',
      answer:
        'Eleva Care provides the secure technology platform, booking tools and payments. Your chosen physiotherapist or clinician is an independent, licensed professional who is responsible for your clinical assessment, decisions and prescriptions. We verify credentials, support best-practice telehealth workflows and provide educational resources, but clinical judgment always rests with your expert.',
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-5',
      question: 'When should I see someone in person?',
      answer:
        'In-person care is recommended when there are signs that require hands-on examination or urgent evaluation—such as new severe pain, suspected nerve involvement (for example, marked weakness, changes in bladder or bowel control), unexplained fever, trauma, or any symptom your physiotherapist considers unsafe to manage remotely. Some assessments (like internal pelvic exams or certain imaging-guided procedures) must also be done in person. Your clinician will help you decide when telehealth is appropriate and when to seek local care.',
