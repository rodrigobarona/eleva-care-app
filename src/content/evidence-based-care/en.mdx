      answer:
        'For many visits—yes. Evidence shows similar clinical outcomes for many telehealth services; but some visits (procedures, certain physical exams) still require face-to-face care. Research from 38 meta-analyses found telehealth is as effective or more effective than usual in-person care across many specialties.',
