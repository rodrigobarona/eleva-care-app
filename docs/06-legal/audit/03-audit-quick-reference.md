## ⚠️ Critical Gaps Identified

### Healthcare Compliance Gaps

#### Missing BAAs (Business Associate Agreements)

```
Need BAAs with:
❌ Neon.tech (Database) - Request immediately
❌ Vercel (Hosting) - Requires Enterprise plan
❌ Upstash (Redis/QStash) - Request immediately
❌ PostHog (Analytics) - Request immediately
✅ Stripe - Available, needs execution
✅ Clerk - Available, needs execution
```

**Impact**: Cannot legally operate healthcare platform without these

#### HIPAA Compliance Gaps

- ❌ No formal Security Risk Assessment
- ❌ No designated HIPAA Security Officer
- ❌ Incomplete PHI access audit trail
- ❌ No incident response plan
- ❌ No breach notification procedures
- ❌ No workforce training documentation

### Testing Coverage Gaps

**Critical Missing Tests:**

```typescript
// PHI Handling (HIGHEST RISK)
❌ /api/records/ - Patient record retrieval
❌ /api/appointments/[meetingId]/records/ - Record management
❌ /api/appointments/patients/[email] - Patient data access

// User Management
❌ /api/auth/user-authorization - Authorization checks
❌ /api/user/profile - Profile management
❌ /api/user/identity - Identity verification

// System Health
❌ /api/diagnostics - System monitoring
❌ /api/healthcheck - Service availability
```

**Component Coverage**: Only 5% - critical UI components untested
