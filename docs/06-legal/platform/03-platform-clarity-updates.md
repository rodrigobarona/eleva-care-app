# ‚úÖ Platform Clarity Updates - Legal Liability Protection

**Eleva.care Marketplace Platform Disclaimers**

---

## Executive Summary

Based on the clarification that Eleva.care is a **marketplace platform** (like Airbnb for healthcare), I've updated ALL public-facing content to make this **crystal clear** and protect against legal liability from misunderstandings.

**Goal**: Ensure no user (patient or practitioner) can claim they thought Eleva.care was their healthcare provider.

## üö® Critical Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ About Page (`content/about/en.mdx`)

    We connect patients with independent, licensed healthcare practitioners through our secure
    digital marketplace. Eleva Care provides the technology platform; your healthcare provider
    delivers your medical care.
  </p>
</div>
```

**Changed ALL Language**:

- ‚ùå "comprehensive healthcare platform" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "technology marketplace"

**Added Prominent Disclaimer at Top**:

```markdown
**IMPORTANT**: Eleva.care is a **healthcare technology marketplace platform**
that connects patients with independent, licensed healthcare practitioners.
We are NOT a healthcare provider. This Privacy Policy covers how WE (Eleva.care)
handle your platform data. Your healthcare practitioner has their own separate
responsibilities for the medical data they create.

## Eleva.care's Dual Role in Data Processing

Eleva.care processes your data in **two distinct capacities**:

### As Data Controller (Platform Operations)

For the following data, **Eleva.care is the data controller**:

- Your account information (name, email, phone number)
- Booking and scheduling information
- Payment information (processed via Stripe)
- Platform usage analytics
- Communications with our support team

**Legal Basis**: Contract performance (GDPR Article 6(1)(b))

### As Data Processor (Clinical Data Storage)

For clinical session notes and medical records created by practitioners:

- **The healthcare practitioner is the data controller**
- **Eleva.care provides secure encrypted storage only**
- We process this data ONLY on the practitioner's instructions
- We do NOT access clinical notes without authorization

**Legal Basis**:

- Practitioners rely on GDPR Article 9(2)(h) (healthcare provision)
- You consent to platform storage via Article 9(2)(a) (explicit consent)
```
