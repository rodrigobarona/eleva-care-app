# Expert Onboarding Implementation - Summary

## What Has Been Accomplished

### Core Infrastructure

âœ… **Database Schema**

- Created migration for expert-specific fields (`username`, `expert_bio`, `expert_specialties`, etc.)
- Added `stripe_connect_account_id` and `stripe_identity_verification_id` fields
- Designed schema for tracking onboarding progress

âœ… **State Management**

- Implemented `ExpertOnboardingProvider` to manage onboarding state
- Created API routes for storing and retrieving onboarding status
- Implemented step completion tracking system

âœ… **UI Components**

- Created `FadeInSection` component for smooth transitions
- Built `OnboardingStepNav` for step navigation
- Implemented responsive form components with validation

âœ… **API Routes**

- Connected and implemented `/api/events` for event management
- Implemented `/api/identity/status` for identity verification
- Implemented `/api/stripe/connect/status` for Stripe Connect
- Added `/api/events/check-slug` for URL validation

### Onboarding Flow Pages

âœ… **Main Onboarding Page**

- Overview of all steps
- Progress tracking
- Navigation to individual steps

âœ… **Username Step**

- Form with real-time validation
- Username availability checking
- Error handling

âœ… **Events Step**

- Event creation form
- Listing of created events
- Validation and error handling

âœ… **Schedule Step**

- Weekly schedule interface
- Business hours configuration
- Default schedule setup

âœ… **Profile Step**

- Bio collection
- Dynamic specialties list
- Qualifications with institution and year

âœ… **Billing Step**

- Stripe Connect integration
- Status checking
- Progress indication

âœ… **Identity Step**

- Stripe Identity integration
- Status checking
- Verification process explanation

### Testing & Validation

âœ… **Middleware Testing**

- Created script for testing with different user roles
- Implemented route protection based on roles
- Added onboarding completion checks

âœ… **Form Validation**

- Implemented Zod schemas for all forms
- Added client-side and server-side validation
- Added interactive error feedback

## What Remains To Be Done

### Infrastructure

ðŸ”² **Production Configuration**

- Configure Stripe webhooks for identity verification status updates
- Set up proper error monitoring and logging
- Fine-tune database indexes for performance

### Enhancements

ðŸ”² **Email Notifications**

- Send welcome email when expert account is created
- Send reminder emails for incomplete onboarding steps
- Notify when identity verification is complete

ðŸ”² **Progressive Profile Building**

- Add ability to save partial progress on forms
- Implement draft mode for unpublished profiles
- Add profile preview functionality

ðŸ”² **Enhanced Validation**

- Add qualification verification process
- Implement review process for expert profiles
- Add content moderation for profile bios

### Testing

ðŸ”² **End-to-End Testing**

- Write Playwright or Cypress tests for full onboarding flow
- Test with different user roles and scenarios
- Test edge cases like network failures

ðŸ”² **Performance Testing**

- Test with large numbers of experts/events
- Test onboarding flow performance across devices
- Optimize loading times for onboarding steps

### Documentation

ðŸ”² **User Documentation**

- Create onboarding guide for experts
- Document verification requirements with examples
- Create FAQ for common onboarding issues

ðŸ”² **Developer Documentation**

- Document API endpoints with OpenAPI spec
- Add detailed comments to complex code sections
- Create architecture diagrams for onboarding flow

## Next Steps

1. **Run the implementation** with `npm run run-migrations` to apply database changes
2. **Test with real users** to gather feedback on the onboarding experience
3. **Monitor onboarding metrics** to identify bottlenecks or dropout points
4. **Iterate and improve** based on user feedback and metrics

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Completed)**: Core infrastructure and basic flow
- **Phase 2 (Next 2 weeks)**: Production configuration and webhooks
- **Phase 3 (Next 4 weeks)**: Enhancements and email notifications
- **Phase 4 (Next 6 weeks)**: Comprehensive testing and documentation
