# IMMEDIATE FIX: Clear Corrupted Clerk Cache

**Issue**: `"[object Object]" is not valid JSON` errors when loading profile pages

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fix deployed, cache needs clearing

## Quick Solution Options

Choose **ONE** of these options to immediately stop the errors:

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 1: Run the Cache Clear Script (RECOMMENDED)**

This will find and delete all corrupted Clerk cache entries from Redis:

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/clear-clerk-cache-now.ts
```

**Expected output:**

```
üîÑ Starting immediate Clerk cache cleanup...
‚úÖ Connected to Upstash Redis
üîç Searching for keys matching: clerk:username:*
   üìã Found 3 keys to delete
   ‚úÖ Deleted: clerk:username:patimota
   ‚úÖ Deleted: clerk:username:johndoe
   ‚úÖ Deleted: clerk:username:janedoe
‚úÖ Cache cleanup complete! Deleted 3 keys.
üéâ Clerk cache has been cleared successfully!
```

**Time**: 5-10 seconds  
**Impact**: Immediate - errors stop right away

---

### Option 2: Temporarily Disable Redis

Add this to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
DISABLE_REDIS=true
```

Then restart your dev server:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
pnpm dev
```

**What happens:**

- Redis is bypassed temporarily
- App uses in-memory cache instead
- No corrupted data to read
- Errors stop immediately

**To re-enable Redis later:**

1. Remove `DISABLE_REDIS=true` from `.env.local`
2. Restart the server
3. Fresh cache will be built correctly

**Time**: 30 seconds  
**Impact**: Immediate, but disables Redis benefits

---

### Option 3: Wait for Natural Expiry

The corrupted cache has a 5-minute TTL. Just wait and it will expire naturally.

**What happens:**

- Cache entries expire after 5 minutes
- Next request fetches fresh data
- New cache is stored correctly
- Errors stop after 5 minutes

**Time**: 5 minutes  
**Impact**: Gradual - errors decrease over time

---

### Option 4: Manual Redis Cleanup

If you have access to Upstash Redis dashboard:

1. Go to https://console.upstash.com/
2. Select your Redis database
3. Go to **Data Browser** or **CLI**
4. Run these commands:

```redis
DEL clerk:username:patimota
DEL clerk:id:user_2tYRmKEdAbmZUJUDPvkIzzdnMvq
KEYS clerk:*
# Delete any remaining clerk:* keys you see
```

**Time**: 1-2 minutes  
**Impact**: Immediate

---

## Why This Happened

The corrupted cache was created before the type validation fix. The entries contain the literal string `"[object Object]"` instead of properly JSON-stringified user data.

## What Was Fixed

The code now:

1. ‚úÖ Validates data types before JSON parsing
2. ‚úÖ Automatically deletes corrupted cache entries
3. ‚úÖ Fetches fresh data from Clerk API
4. ‚úÖ Stores data correctly
5. ‚úÖ Prevents future corruption

## Verification

After clearing the cache, you should see:

**Before (with corrupted cache):**

```
Failed to parse cached Clerk user by username: SyntaxError: "[object Object]" is not valid JSON
Failed to parse cached Clerk user by ID: SyntaxError: "[object Object]" is not valid JSON
```

**After (with cleared cache):**

```
‚úÖ Redis client initialized successfully
[ProfileAccessControl] User found for username: patimota
[ProfileInfo] Loading profile for clerkUserId: user_2tYRmKEdAbmZUJUDPvkIzzdnMvq
```

No more JSON parse errors! üéâ

## Need Help?

If you're still seeing errors after trying these options, check:

1. **Verify Redis connection**: Check logs for "‚úÖ Redis client initialized successfully"
2. **Check environment variables**: Ensure `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are set
3. **Try a different option**: If one doesn't work, try another from above
4. **Check Upstash dashboard**: Verify the database is running and accessible
