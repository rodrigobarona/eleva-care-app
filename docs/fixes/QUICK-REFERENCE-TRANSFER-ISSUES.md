# Quick Reference: Stripe Transfer Issues

**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025

---

## ‚ö° Quick Diagnosis

### Symptom: "Transfer already exists for this charge"

**Error Message:**

```
Transfers using this transaction as a source must not exceed
the source amount of ‚Ç¨XX.XX. (There is already a transfer using
this source, amounting to ‚Ç¨XX.XX.)
```

**Quick Fix:**

1. Check if transfer exists in Stripe Dashboard
2. If yes, manually update database record with transfer ID
3. System will auto-sync on next cron run after fix deployment

**Prevention:**

- ‚úÖ **FIXED** ‚Äî pending v1.1.0 release
- Both cron jobs now check Stripe before creating transfers
- Self-healing: syncs database with Stripe automatically

## üîç How to Check Transfer Status

### In Database

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  payment_intent_id,
  status,
  transfer_id,
  scheduled_transfer_time,
  created,
  updated,
  stripe_error_message
FROM payment_transfers
WHERE payment_intent_id = 'pi_xxxxx';
```

### In Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments
2. Search for Payment Intent: `pi_xxxxx`
3. Click on payment
4. Scroll to "Transfers" section
5. Check if transfer exists

### Via Stripe API (curl)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning:** The examples below use raw API keys in curl commands, which can expose secrets in shell history and process listings. **Recommended:** Use the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) instead (e.g., `stripe charges retrieve ch_xxx`) to avoid handling raw secrets directly.

```bash
# Get the payment intent
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/pi_xxxxx \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}"

# Get the charge with transfer expanded
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/py_xxxxx?expand[]=transfer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}"
```

**Safer alternative with Stripe CLI:**

```bash
# Get the payment intent
stripe payment_intents retrieve pi_xxxxx

# Get the charge with transfer expanded
stripe charges retrieve py_xxxxx --expand transfer
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Fix Steps

### If Database Shows `transferId: NULL` but Stripe Has Transfer

**Scenario:** Cron fails, database out of sync with Stripe

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** Prefer using the Stripe CLI when available to avoid exposing secrets. The curl examples below are provided for reference but can leak secrets via shell history.

**Steps:**

#### Step 1: Get the charge ID

```bash
# Using curl (less secure)
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/pi_xxxxx \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}" \
  | jq '.latest_charge'

# Using Stripe CLI (recommended)
stripe payment_intents retrieve pi_xxxxx --format json | jq '.latest_charge'
```

#### Step 2: Get the transfer ID

```bash
# Using curl (less secure)
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/py_xxxxx?expand[]=transfer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}" \
  | jq '.transfer.id'

# Using Stripe CLI (recommended)
stripe charges retrieve py_xxxxx --expand transfer --format json | jq '.transfer.id'
```

#### Step 3: Update database

```sql
UPDATE payment_transfers
SET
  transfer_id = 'tr_xxxxx',
  status = 'COMPLETED',
  updated = NOW()
WHERE payment_intent_id = 'pi_xxxxx';
```

#### Step 4: Verify

```bash
# Next cron run should show: "‚úÖ Updated database with existing transfer ID"
```

## üìä Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Card Payment

```
Timeline:
1. Customer pays with card ‚Üí instant confirmation
2. Webhook fires ‚Üí creates DB record
3. transfer_data.destination ‚Üí Stripe auto-creates transfer
4. Cron runs ‚Üí detects existing transfer ‚Üí syncs DB
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Works perfectly after fix

### Scenario 2: Multibanco Payment

```
Timeline:
1. Customer receives reference ‚Üí status PENDING
2. Customer pays (1-12 hours later)
3. Stripe confirms payment
4. Webhook fires ‚Üí creates DB record with transferId: NULL
5. transfer_data.destination ‚Üí Stripe auto-creates transfer
6. Cron runs (next day) ‚Üí detects existing transfer ‚Üí syncs DB
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - was the problematic case

### Scenario 3: Manual Approval Required

```
Timeline:
1. Payment succeeds
2. Webhook creates DB record with status: PENDING
3. Admin approves ‚Üí status: APPROVED
4. Cron runs ‚Üí creates transfer (no existing transfer)
5. Updates DB with transfer ID
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Works as expected

## üîß Debugging Commands

### Check Pending Transfers

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total,
  status,
  DATE(scheduled_transfer_time) as scheduled_date
FROM payment_transfers
WHERE transfer_id IS NULL
GROUP BY status, DATE(scheduled_transfer_time)
ORDER BY scheduled_date DESC;
```

### Check Failed Transfers

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  payment_intent_id,
  expert_clerk_user_id,
  amount,
  scheduled_transfer_time,
  retry_count,
  stripe_error_message
FROM payment_transfers
WHERE status = 'FAILED'
ORDER BY updated DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Stuck Transfers

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  payment_intent_id,
  status,
  scheduled_transfer_time,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - scheduled_transfer_time))/3600 as hours_overdue
FROM payment_transfers
WHERE
  status IN ('PENDING', 'READY', 'APPROVED')
  AND transfer_id IS NULL
  AND scheduled_transfer_time < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY hours_overdue DESC;
```

## üìà Monitoring Queries

### Today's Transfer Status

```sql
SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(amount)/100.0 as total_euros
FROM payment_transfers
WHERE DATE(scheduled_transfer_time) = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY status;
```

### Expert Payout Summary

```sql
SELECT
  expert_clerk_user_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_transfers,
  SUM(CASE WHEN transfer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed,
  SUM(CASE WHEN transfer_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as pending,
  SUM(amount)/100.0 as total_amount_euros
FROM payment_transfers
WHERE scheduled_transfer_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY expert_clerk_user_id
ORDER BY total_amount_euros DESC;
```

## üö® When to Escalate

### Immediate Escalation

1. **Multiple consecutive failures** (3+ in a row)
2. **Transfer stuck > 48 hours** after scheduled time
3. **Expert reports missing payment** and transfer shows COMPLETED
4. **Database shows COMPLETED** but Stripe shows no transfer

### Investigation Needed

1. **Retry count > 2** for any transfer
2. **Unusual error messages** not documented here
3. **Transfer amount mismatch** between DB and Stripe
4. **Missing payment intent** or charge in Stripe

## üéì Key Concepts

### PaymentIntent vs Charge vs Transfer

```
PaymentIntent (pi_xxx)
  ‚Üì creates
Charge (ch_xxx or py_xxx)
  ‚Üì funds
Transfer (tr_xxx)
  ‚Üì goes to
Connect Account (acct_xxx)
  ‚Üì creates
Payout (po_xxx)
  ‚Üì arrives at
Bank Account
```

### Transfer States in Our System

```
PENDING     ‚Üí Waiting for scheduled time
READY       ‚Üí Ready to process (payment confirmed)
APPROVED    ‚Üí Manually approved by admin
COMPLETED   ‚Üí Stripe transfer created successfully
FAILED      ‚Üí Failed after max retries
PAID_OUT    ‚Üí Payout created to bank account
```

### Automatic vs Manual Transfers

**Automatic (via transfer_data.destination):**

- Stripe creates transfer when charge succeeds
- No API call from our system needed
- Transfer ID not immediately available
- Requires syncing to get transfer ID

**Manual (via stripe.transfers.create):**

- We explicitly create the transfer
- Full control over timing
- Immediate transfer ID in response
- Requires active API call
