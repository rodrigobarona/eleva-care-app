# Vercel Deployment Fix - DATABASE_URL Error

## Problem Summary

The error `"FATAL: DATABASE_URL is required in production environment"` was appearing in the **browser console** (client-side), which indicates that server-side database validation code was being executed on the client.

## Root Cause

The database modules (`drizzle/db.ts` and `drizzle/auditDb.ts`) were:

1. Being imported by components without proper server-side protection
2. Running validation code at module initialization time
3. Getting bundled into client-side JavaScript chunks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Server-Only Protection

Added `import 'server-only';` to both database modules:

- `/drizzle/db.ts` (line 1)
- `/drizzle/auditDb.ts` (line 1)

This ensures that if these modules are accidentally imported by client components, the build will **fail** with a clear error message rather than silently bundling server code into the client.

### 2. Verified Server Components

Confirmed that components importing database modules are Server Components:

- `components/sections/home/ExpertsSection.tsx` ✅ (Server Component)
- `components/features/booking/EventBookingList.tsx` ✅ (Server Component)
- `components/auth/ProfileAccessControl.tsx` ✅ (Server Component)

## Next Steps

### 1. **Configure Environment Variables in Vercel**

You MUST add the following environment variables to your Vercel project:

#### Critical (Required):

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]/[database]
AUDITLOG_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]/[audit-database]
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
```

#### Recommended:

```bash
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...
QSTASH_TOKEN=...
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
NOVU_API_KEY=...
```

#### Public (Client-Side):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://eleva.care
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_NOVU_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=...
```

### 2. **How to Add Environment Variables in Vercel**

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project (`eleva-care-app`)
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add each variable:
   - **Key**: The variable name (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`)
   - **Value**: The actual value (e.g., your Neon database URL)
   - **Environments**: Select `Production`, `Preview`, and `Development` as needed

5. **Important**: After adding environment variables, you must **redeploy** your application:

   ```bash
   # Option 1: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard
   # Go to Deployments → Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

   # Option 2: Trigger new deployment with git push
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy with env vars"
   git push
   ```

### 3. **Verify Deployment**

After redeployment, check:

1. ✅ No errors in browser console
2. ✅ Application loads correctly
3. ✅ Database connections work
4. ✅ No "DATABASE_URL is required" errors

## Build Verification

To verify locally before deploying:

```bash
# 1. Set environment variables in .env.local
# 2. Build the application
pnpm build

# 3. Check for any build errors
# 4. If successful, the deployment should work
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "server-only module imported by client"

**Solution**: A client component is trying to import the database module. Refactor to use Server Components or API routes.

### Issue: Environment variables not working

**Solution**:

1. Verify environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
2. Make sure you've redeployed after adding them
3. Check that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Issue: Still seeing DATABASE_URL error after adding env vars

**Solution**:

1. Clear Vercel build cache: Settings → General → Clear Build Cache
2. Trigger a new deployment
3. Verify the environment variable value is correct (no spaces, correct format)

## Database URL Format

Your Neon database URL should look like this:

```
postgresql://[username]:[password]@[hostname]/[database]?sslmode=require
```

Example (with placeholders):

```
postgresql://user_12345:abc123xyz@ep-cool-name-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/main?sslmode=require
```

## Security Notes

- ✅ Server-only modules are now protected from client bundling
- ✅ Environment validation only runs server-side
- ✅ No sensitive data is exposed to the browser
- ⚠️ Never commit `.env` files to git
- ⚠️ Use `.env.local` for local development only

## Testing Checklist

Before marking as complete:

- [ ] Added `server-only` import to database modules
- [ ] Configured all required environment variables in Vercel
- [ ] Redeployed application to Vercel
- [ ] Verified no browser console errors
- [ ] Tested database queries work
- [ ] Verified authentication works
- [ ] Checked that pages load correctly

## Questions?

If you still experience issues after following these steps:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are present and correctly formatted
3. Ensure you've redeployed after adding environment variables
4. Check that your database is accessible from Vercel's infrastructure
