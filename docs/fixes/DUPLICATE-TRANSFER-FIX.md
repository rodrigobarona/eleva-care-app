# Stripe Duplicate Transfer Fix

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Issue:** Duplicate transfer error preventing expert payouts  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🚨 Critical Issue

**Error Message:**

```
Error creating Stripe transfer: Error: Transfers using this transaction as a source must not exceed the source amount of €70.00. (There is already a transfer using this source, amounting to €70.00.)
```

**Impact:** Cron jobs were attempting to create duplicate Stripe transfers, causing:

- Failed expert payouts
- Database records stuck in `PENDING` state
- Retry loops increasing error logs
- Expert payment delays

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The system had **two different paths** that could create Stripe transfers:

1. **Webhook Path** (`/app/api/webhooks/stripe/handlers/payment.ts`)
   - Triggered when Multibanco payment succeeds
   - Creates transfer record in database with `checkoutSessionId: 'UNKNOWN'`
   - Status set to `READY`
   - **May or may not create actual Stripe transfer immediately**

2. **Cron Job Path** (`/app/api/cron/process-tasks/route.ts`)
   - Runs daily to process pending transfers
   - Queries for transfers where `transferId IS NULL`
   - **Attempts to create Stripe transfer without checking if one already exists**

### Why Duplicates Occurred

For **Multibanco payments** specifically:

1. Payment is created → status is `PENDING`
2. Customer pays via Multibanco → can take 1-12 hours
3. When payment succeeds:
   - Webhook `payment_intent.succeeded` fires
   - Creates transfer record with `status: 'READY'`
   - **Webhook may create Stripe transfer via Connect destination**
4. Next day, cron job runs:
   - Finds transfer where `transferId IS NULL`
   - **Tries to create ANOTHER Stripe transfer from same charge**
   - Stripe rejects: "Transfer already exists for this charge"

### The Race Condition

```
Webhook                    Cron Job
   │                          │
   ├─ Payment succeeds        │
   ├─ Create DB record        │
   ├─ transferId = NULL       │
   │  (may have Stripe        │
   │   transfer via           │
   │   destination)           │
   │                          │
   │                     ─────┤
   │                     Find │ transferId IS NULL
   │                     Try  │ Create transfer
   │                     ❌   │ ERROR: Already exists!
```

## ✅ The Solution

### Fix Implementation

Added **duplicate detection** before creating Stripe transfers in both cron jobs:

```typescript
// ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Check if a Stripe transfer already exists for this charge
// This prevents duplicate transfers when webhooks have already processed the payment
// Retrieve the charge to check if it has any transfers already
const charge = await stripe.charges.retrieve(chargeId, {
  expand: ['transfer'],
});

// Check if a transfer already exists for this charge
if (charge.transfer) {
  const existingTransferId = typeof charge.transfer === 'string'
    ? charge.transfer
    : charge.transfer.id;

  console.log(
    `⚠️ Transfer ${existingTransferId} already exists for charge ${chargeId}, skipping creation`,
  );

  // Update our database record with the existing transfer ID
  await db
    .update(PaymentTransferTable)
    .set({
      status: 'COMPLETED',
      transferId: existingTransferId,
      updated: new Date(),
    })
    .where(eq(PaymentTransferTable.id, transfer.id));

  console.log(
    `✅ Updated database record ${transfer.id} with existing transfer ID: ${existingTransferId}`,
  );

  return {
    success: true,
    transferId: existingTransferId,
    paymentTransferId: transfer.id,
  } as SuccessResult;
}

// Only create transfer if none exists
const stripeTransfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
  amount: transfer.amount,
  currency: transfer.currency,
  destination: transfer.expertConnectAccountId,
  source_transaction: chargeId,
  // ... metadata
});
```

### Files Modified

1. **`/app/api/cron/process-tasks/route.ts`**
   - Added duplicate check before transfer creation
   - Updates database record with existing transfer ID

2. **`/app/api/cron/process-expert-transfers/route.ts`**
   - Same duplicate check logic
   - Ensures aging requirements don't cause duplicates

### Why This Works

1. **Uses Stripe as source of truth**: Checks the charge object directly
2. **Efficient**: Single API call with `expand: ['transfer']`
3. **Idempotent**: Can run multiple times safely
4. **Self-healing**: Syncs database with actual Stripe state
5. **Prevents race conditions**: Checks before every transfer creation

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Normal Flow (No Duplicate)

```
1. Webhook creates transfer record
2. Cron runs → finds charge has no transfer
3. Cron creates transfer successfully
4. Database updated with transfer ID
```

**Result:** ✅ Transfer created successfully

#### Scenario 2: Webhook Already Created Transfer

```
1. Webhook creates transfer via destination charge
2. Cron runs → finds charge ALREADY has transfer
3. Cron skips creation
4. Database updated with existing transfer ID
```

**Result:** ✅ No duplicate, database synced

#### Scenario 3: Manual Stripe Transfer

```
1. Admin creates transfer manually in Stripe
2. Cron runs → finds charge has transfer
3. Cron skips creation
4. Database updated with existing transfer ID
```

**Result:** ✅ System self-heals to match Stripe

## 📊 Monitoring

### Success Indicators

- **No more duplicate transfer errors** in logs
- **Transfers complete on first attempt**
- **Database `transferId` populated** for all completed transfers
- **Expert payouts arrive on schedule**

### Log Messages to Watch

✅ **Good:**

```
⚠️ Transfer tr_xxx already exists for charge ch_xxx, skipping creation
✅ Updated database record 123 with existing transfer ID: tr_xxx
Successfully transferred 59.50 EUR to expert user_xxx
```

❌ **Bad (should not see anymore):**

```
Error creating Stripe transfer: Transfers using this transaction as a source must not exceed...
```

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Always check Stripe before creating resources**
   - Don't assume local database is source of truth
   - Stripe may have state from webhooks, manual actions, or other systems

2. **Expand related objects efficiently**
   - `expand: ['transfer']` prevents extra API calls
   - Single request gets all needed data

3. **Handle race conditions at creation time**
   - Don't rely on database constraints alone
   - Check external systems before mutations

4. **Make operations idempotent**
   - Safe to retry without side effects
   - System self-heals from inconsistent states

5. **Multibanco requires special handling**
   - Delayed payment confirmation (1-12 hours)
   - Multiple webhook events
   - Recalculated transfer schedules
