## 🔍 Flow Verification by Payment Method

### 💳 Card Payments (Immediate)

**✅ Verified Flow:**

```
1. User fills form → Submit button
2. createPaymentIntent() → API call with idempotency-key
3. API checks conflicts → Creates Stripe session (card only if <72h)
4. User redirected to Stripe → Pays with card instantly
5. payment_intent.created webhook → No action (card payment)
6. checkout.session.completed webhook → Meeting created immediately
7. User redirected to success page
```

**✅ Characteristics Verified:**

- No slot reservations created at any point
- Instant confirmation after payment
- Meeting record serves as final booking
- No orphaned data

### 🏧 Multibanco Payments (Delayed)

**✅ Verified Flow:**

```
1. User fills form → Submit button
2. createPaymentIntent() → API call (>72h appointment)
3. API creates Stripe session (card + multibanco)
4. User selects Multibanco → Receives voucher/reference
5. payment_intent.created webhook → 24h slot reservation created
6. User pays at ATM/bank within 24h
7. checkout.session.completed webhook → Meeting created + reservation deleted
8. User redirected to success page
```

**✅ Characteristics Verified:**

- Slot held for 24 hours during payment period
- Automatic cleanup after payment confirmation
- Voucher-based payment process
- No double-booking possible

## 🛡️ Protection Mechanisms Verified

### Race Condition Prevention

```typescript
// ✅ Frontend: Immediate duplicate prevention
const isProcessingRef = React.useRef(false);
if (isProcessingRef.current) return; // Blocks immediately

// ✅ Backend: Idempotency cache
const cachedResult = idempotencyCache.get(idempotencyKey);
if (cachedResult) return cachedResult; // Returns cached response

// ✅ Database: Unique constraints
CONSTRAINT unique_active_reservation
  UNIQUE (event_id, start_time, guest_email)
  WHERE expires_at > NOW()
```

### Conflict Detection

```typescript
// ✅ Verified: Checks existing reservations before session creation
const existingReservation = await db.query.SlotReservationTable.findFirst({
  where: and(
    eq(SlotReservationTable.eventId, eventId),
    eq(SlotReservationTable.startTime, appointmentStartTime),
    gt(SlotReservationTable.expiresAt, new Date()),
  ),
});

if (existingReservation && existingReservation.guestEmail !== guestEmail) {
  return 409; // Slot temporarily reserved
}
```

### Data Integrity

```typescript
// ✅ Verified: Guest notes preserved through complete flow
const MeetingMetadataSchema = z.object({
  notes: z.string().optional(), // Added to schema
});

// ✅ Verified: Proper cleanup after meeting creation
const deletedReservations = await db
  .delete(SlotReservationTable)
  .where(eq(SlotReservationTable.stripePaymentIntentId, paymentIntentId));
```

## 📊 Test Coverage Verification

### ✅ Unit Tests (create-payment-intent.test.ts)

- [x] Payment method selection logic (16 tests passing)
- [x] Idempotency handling
- [x] Slot reservation conflict detection
- [x] Database interactions
- [x] Stripe integration
- [x] Metadata validation
- [x] Error handling scenarios
- [x] No premature slot reservations

### ✅ Build Verification

- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] All routes properly built
- [x] QStash schedules updated

## 🔄 Cron Job Integration

### ✅ cleanup-expired-reservations (Every 15 minutes)

```typescript
// Handles abandoned Multibanco payments
// Removes expired reservations automatically
// Logs cleanup actions for monitoring
```

### ✅ Other Scheduled Jobs

- [x] `process-expert-transfers` - Every 2 hours
- [x] `check-upcoming-payouts` - Daily at noon
- [x] `cleanup-blocked-dates` - Daily at midnight
- [x] `appointment-reminders` - Daily at 9 AM

## 🎯 Key Architecture Decisions Validated

### 1. **No Premature Reservations**

**✅ CORRECT**: Slot reservations are ONLY created in webhook handlers for Multibanco payments during the pending state. This prevents:

- Blocking slots for abandoned card payment attempts
- Orphaned reservations from network issues
- Race conditions during checkout creation

### 2. **Payment Method Timing Logic**

**✅ CORRECT**:

- **<= 72 hours**: Card only (instant confirmation needed)
- **> 72 hours**: Card + Multibanco (time for delayed payment)

### 3. **Idempotency at Multiple Levels**

**✅ CORRECT**:

- Frontend: Immediate ref-based blocking
- Backend: Request-level caching with TTL
- Database: Unique constraints for data integrity

### 4. **Proper Metadata Handling**

**✅ CORRECT**: Metadata split into logical chunks (meeting, payment, transfer) to stay under Stripe's 500-character limit while maintaining full functionality.

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations Verified

- [x] **Prefetching**: Checkout URLs prefetched on step 2 completion
- [x] **Memoization**: React.useCallback for expensive operations
- [x] **Lazy Loading**: Step components rendered only when needed
- [x] **Cache Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired idempotency entries

## 🏁 Final Verification Summary

### ✅ Complete Flow Working

1. **Frontend**: Duplicate prevention, proper UX, error handling
2. **API**: Idempotency, conflict detection, no premature reservations
3. **Stripe**: Proper session creation, metadata, payment methods
