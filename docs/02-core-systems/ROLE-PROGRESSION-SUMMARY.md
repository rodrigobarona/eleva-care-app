## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Why quarterly evaluation instead of monthly?**  
A: Provides stability and reduces anxiety. Experts need time to adjust and improve. Airbnb uses similar cadence.

**Q: Can a Top Expert be demoted?**  
A: Yes, if metrics fall below threshold. But there's a 1-month grace period to improve.

**Q: What if an expert doesn't want subscription, prefers commission only?**  
A: Great question! We should offer both: either flat subscription OR commission-only at a higher rate (20% vs 10/15%). Add this option.

**Q: How do we prevent gaming the system?**  
A: Multiple metrics balance each other. Can't fake response rate AND booking volume AND ratings simultaneously.

**Q: What about experts in multiple specialties?**  
A: One role applies to the account. They can offer multiple services under that role.
