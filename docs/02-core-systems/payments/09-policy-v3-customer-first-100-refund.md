## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Refund Processing Function

**File:** `app/api/webhooks/stripe/handlers/payment.ts`

**Before (v2.0):**

```typescript
const isBlockedDateConflict = conflictType === 'expert_blocked_date';
const refundAmount = isBlockedDateConflict
  ? originalAmount // 100% refund - expert's fault
  : Math.floor(originalAmount * 0.9); // 90% refund - customer paid late
const processingFee = originalAmount - refundAmount;
const refundPercentage = isBlockedDateConflict ? '100' : '90';
```

**After (v3.0):**

```typescript
// üÜï CUSTOMER-FIRST POLICY (v3.0): Always 100% refund for any conflict
// No processing fees charged - Eleva Care absorbs the cost
const refundAmount = originalAmount; // Always 100% refund
const processingFee = 0; // No fee charged
const refundPercentage = '100';
```

#### 2. Stripe Metadata

**Updated fields:**

```typescript
metadata: {
  reason: reason,
  conflict_type: conflictType,
  original_amount: originalAmount.toString(),
  processing_fee: '0', // Always 0 now
  refund_percentage: '100', // Always 100% now
  policy_version: '3.0', // Updated version
}
```

#### 3. Email Notification Logic

**File:** `app/api/webhooks/stripe/handlers/payment.ts` (lines 387-468)

No changes needed! The function already uses i18n translations from `messages/*.json`, which we updated.

**How it works:**

1. Function calls `getTranslations({ locale, namespace: 'Payments.collision' })`
2. Retrieves localized messages from updated JSON files
3. Automatically shows correct 100% refund messaging

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Refund not processed

**Symptoms:**

console.log('‚úÖ üéÅ Full refund (100%) processed:');
```

**Solutions:**

1. Check Stripe API key permissions

4. Review webhook signature verification

### Issue: Wrong refund amount

**Symptoms:**

**Diagnosis:**

```typescript
// Check refund metadata:
refund.metadata.policy_version; // Should be '3.0'
refund.metadata.refund_percentage; // Should be '100'
refund.metadata.processing_fee; // Should be '0'
```

**Solutions:**

1. Verify latest code is deployed
2. Check for caching issues
3. Review Stripe refund object in dashboard
4. Confirm policy_version metadata is '3.0'

### Issue: Email shows old 90% policy

**Symptoms:**

- Email mentions 90% refund
- Email shows ‚Ç¨10 processing fee

**Diagnosis:**

1. Check which language file is being used
2. Verify translations were deployed
