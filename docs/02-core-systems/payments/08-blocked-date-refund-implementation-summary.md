# Blocked Date Refund Policy - Implementation Summary

**Date Implemented**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Backend Complete | ✅ Legal Content Updated | ⏳ Email Translations Pending  
**Policy Version**: 2.0 (Simplified Blocked Date Policy)

---

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

Implemented a **simplified refund policy** for late Multibanco payments that differentiates between:

- **100% refund** (no fee) when expert blocks a date AFTER customer booking
- **90% refund** (10% fee) when customer pays late and slot is lost to other conflicts

This policy is **more customer-friendly**, **easier to understand**, and **reduces platform liability** by acknowledging when conflicts are the platform's responsibility vs. the customer's.

---

## 🎯 **Business Logic**

### **Refund Decision Tree**

```
Late Multibanco Payment Received (>7 days after voucher)
                    ↓
        Check Appointment Conflict
                    ↓
          ┌─────────┴─────────┐
          ↓                   ↓
    PRIORITY 1:         PRIORITY 2/3:
   Blocked Date?    Other Conflicts?
          ↓                   ↓
         YES                 YES
          ↓                   ↓
    100% REFUND          90% REFUND
  (Expert's fault)    (Customer paid late)
```

### **Conflict Priority Order**

1. **Blocked Dates** (checked first) → 100% refund
   - Expert blocked the date after booking was made
   - Platform's responsibility to prevent this

2. **Time Overlaps** (checked second) → 90% refund
   - Slot was booked by another customer
   - Customer paid too late

3. **Minimum Notice** (checked third) → 90% refund
   - Appointment violates expert's minimum notice requirement
   - Customer paid too late

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified**

#### **1. Payment Webhook Handler**

**File**: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/handlers/payment.ts`

**Changes**:

- ✅ Added `BlockedDatesTable` import
- ✅ Enhanced `checkAppointmentConflict()` to check blocked dates FIRST
- ✅ Updated `processPartialRefund()` to accept conflict type parameter
- ✅ Implemented 100% vs 90% refund logic based on conflict type
- ✅ Updated `handlePaymentSucceeded()` to pass conflict type
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Key Code Changes**:

```typescript
// Priority 1: Check blocked dates
const appointmentDateString = format(startTime, 'yyyy-MM-dd', { timeZone: 'UTC' });

const blockedDate = await db.query.BlockedDatesTable.findFirst({
  where: and(
    eq(BlockedDatesTable.clerkUserId, expertId),
    eq(BlockedDatesTable.date, appointmentDateString)
  ),
});

if (blockedDate) {
  return {
    hasConflict: true,
    reason: 'expert_blocked_date',
    blockedDateReason: blockedDate.reason || undefined,
  };
}
```

```typescript
// Refund logic
const isBlockedDateConflict = conflictType === 'expert_blocked_date';
const refundAmount = isBlockedDateConflict
  ? originalAmount // 100% refund
  : Math.floor(originalAmount * 0.9); // 90% refund
```

## 🚨 **Critical Considerations**

### **Stripe Metadata**

All refunds now include comprehensive metadata:

```json
{
  "reason": "Human-readable reason",
  "conflict_type": "expert_blocked_date | time_range_overlap | minimum_notice_violation",
  "original_amount": "10000",
  "processing_fee": "0 or 1000",
  "refund_percentage": "100 or 90",
  "is_blocked_date_conflict": "true or false",
  "policy_version": "2.0"
}
```

### **Logging**

Enhanced logging for debugging:

- 🗓️ Blocked date checks logged with date string
- 💰 Refund amounts logged with percentages
- 🎯 Conflict type logged for analytics
- 🚨 Clear indicators for 100% vs 90% refunds

### **Database Queries**

- ✅ **BlockedDatesTable** query uses indexed `clerkUserId`
- ✅ Query formats date as `yyyy-MM-dd` UTC string
- ✅ Efficient: Checked FIRST before other conflicts
- ✅ Falls back gracefully on errors

## 📖 **Developer Guide**

### **How to Test Locally**

# Run all tests
pnpm test blocked-date-refund.test.ts

# Test a specific scenario
pnpm test -t "should process 100% refund for blocked date"

# Run with coverage
pnpm test --coverage blocked-date-refund.test.ts
```

### **How to Test with Stripe CLI**

```bash
# Trigger a payment_intent.succeeded webhook
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded

# With specific metadata
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded \
  --override payment_intent:metadata.meeting='{"expert":"expert_123","start":"2025-02-15T10:00:00Z"}'
```

### **How to Create a Blocked Date**

```bash
# Via API or UI, create a blocked date entry
# Date format: YYYY-MM-DD (UTC)
```
