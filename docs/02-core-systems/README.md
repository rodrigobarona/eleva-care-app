## 📖 Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Document First**: Create implementation guide
2. **Consider Caching**: Add Redis caching for expensive operations
3. **Add Monitoring**: Include health checks and metrics
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
5. **Update Docs**: Keep this README and related docs current
6. **Consider RLS**: Ensure org-scoped queries for data isolation

### Best Practices

- ✅ Use centralized Redis for all caching
- ✅ Always validate payments with Stripe webhooks
- ✅ Implement proper error handling and logging (Sentry)
- ✅ Add PostHog analytics for key user actions
- ✅ Follow existing patterns for consistency
- ✅ Ensure RLS policies for all org-scoped data
- ✅ Use WorkOS sessions for authentication
- ✅ Prefer server actions over API routes

### Code Style

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Server action with auth
'use server';
import { withAuth } from '@workos-inc/authkit-nextjs';

export async function getSubscription() {
  const { user } = await withAuth({ ensureSignedIn: true });
  // ... implementation
}

// ✅ Good: Org-scoped query
const data = await db.query.MeetingsTable.findMany({
  where: eq(MeetingsTable.orgId, orgId),
});

// ❌ Bad: User-scoped query (should be org-scoped)
const data = await db.query.MeetingsTable.findMany({
  where: eq(MeetingsTable.workosUserId, userId),
});
```
