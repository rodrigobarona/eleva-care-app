## üîß **How the Automation Works**

### **When Scripts Run**

#### **Development Setup**

```bash
# First-time setup
npm run test:posthog                # Verify PostHog connection
npm run setup:posthog-dashboards   # Create analytics dashboards

npm run test:novu                   # Verify Novu connection
npm run setup:novu-workflows       # Create notification workflows
```

#### **CI/CD Integration**

- Scripts can be added to deployment pipelines
- Automated dashboard and workflow updates
- Environment-specific configurations

#### **Manual Execution**

- Development team can run scripts anytime
- Safe to run multiple times (updates existing rather than duplicating)
- Permission validation before execution

### **Environment Requirements**

#### **PostHog**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://eu.i.posthog.com
POSTHOG_PROJECT_API_KEY=phx_xxx
```

#### **Novu**

```env
NOVU_SECRET_KEY=novu_xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_NOVU_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER=xxx
NOVU_ADMIN_SUBSCRIBER_ID=admin
```
