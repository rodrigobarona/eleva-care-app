---

## üéØ Prioritization Matrix

### Priority 1: **CRITICAL** üî¥ (Must Monitor)

**Financial operations that directly affect expert payouts and revenue**

| Cron Job                   | Status                 | Schedule      | Why Critical                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `process-expert-transfers` | ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**     | Every 2 hours | Transfers funds to expert Connect accounts. Failure = experts don't get paid!     |
| `process-pending-payouts`  | ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS HEARTBEAT** | Daily         | Creates Stripe payouts to expert bank accounts. Failure = delayed payments!       |
| `send-payment-reminders`   | ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS HEARTBEAT** | Every 6 hours | Sends Multibanco payment reminders. Failure = lost revenue from expired payments! |

### Priority 2: **HIGH** üü† (Should Monitor)

**Customer-facing communications that affect user experience**

| Cron Job                    | Status                 | Schedule           | Why Important                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `appointment-reminders`     | ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS HEARTBEAT** | Daily (24h before) | Sends 24-hour appointment reminders. Failure = no-shows & customer complaints! |
| `appointment-reminders-1hr` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS HEARTBEAT** | Hourly (1h before) | Sends 1-hour appointment reminders. Failure = missed meetings!                 |
| `check-upcoming-payouts`    | ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS HEARTBEAT** | Daily              | Notifies experts about upcoming payouts. Failure = poor expert experience!     |

### Priority 3: **MEDIUM** üü° (Optional)

**Maintenance tasks that improve system health but don't directly impact users**

| Cron Job                       | Status          | Schedule  | Why Optional                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cleanup-expired-reservations` | ‚ÑπÔ∏è **OPTIONAL** | Hourly    | Cleans up expired slot reservations. Gracefully degrades if delayed. |
| `cleanup-blocked-dates`        | ‚ÑπÔ∏è **OPTIONAL** | Daily     | Cleans up old blocked dates. Gracefully degrades if delayed.         |
| `process-tasks`                | ‚ÑπÔ∏è **OPTIONAL** | Scheduled | General task processing. Depends on what tasks it runs.              |

### Priority 4: **SKIP** ‚ö™ (Do Not Monitor)

**Health checks that shouldn't have heartbeat monitoring**

| Cron Job     | Status                | Schedule | Why Skip                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `keep-alive` | ‚ùå **DO NOT MONITOR** | Frequent | This IS a health check itself. Monitoring a monitor creates confusion! |
