# Stripe Connect Payout Settings

This document explains how payout schedules work in the Eleva Care platform with Stripe Connect integration.

## Overview

Eleva Care uses Stripe Connect to handle payments and payouts for expert services. When a client pays for a session, the payment is processed through Stripe, and after the platform fee is deducted, the remaining amount is transferred to the expert's Stripe Connect account. From there, Stripe handles the payout to the expert's bank account according to the configured payout schedule.

## Payout Delays

Stripe enforces minimum payout delays for new Connect accounts. These delays vary by country and are designed to manage risk and comply with financial regulations. The delays are measured in days from when funds are available in the Stripe account to when they are initiated for transfer to the expert's bank account.

### Country-Specific Minimum Delays

Each country has specific minimum payout delay requirements set by Stripe. Here are the minimum delay days for some key countries:

| Country         | Country Code | Minimum Delay (Days) |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| United States   | US           | 2                    |
| United Kingdom  | GB           | 7                    |
| Portugal        | PT           | 7                    |
| Spain           | ES           | 7                    |
| Italy           | IT           | 7                    |
| France          | FR           | 7                    |
| Germany         | DE           | 7                    |
| Canada          | CA           | 7                    |
| Australia       | AU           | 7                    |
| Other Countries | -            | 7 (default)          |

These values may change as Stripe updates its policies. The most up-to-date values are stored in the application configuration in `config/stripe.ts`.

## How Payouts Work

1. A client books and pays for a session
2. The payment is processed through Stripe
3. **Two-condition payout system** ensures compliance and customer protection:
   - **Condition 1**: Payment must be 7+ days old (regulatory compliance)
   - **Condition 2**: Appointment must have ended 24+ hours ago (complaint window)
4. After both conditions are met, our system creates a transfer to the expert's Connect account
5. Immediately after transfer completion, our system creates a payout to the expert's bank account
6. Additional bank processing time (typically 1-2 business days) may apply before funds appear in the expert's account

## Business Model: Service Delivery Assumption

**Similar to Airbnb's approach:**

- Since appointments cannot be cancelled or rescheduled in our system
- We assume service delivery occurred as scheduled
- The 24-hour hold after appointment completion provides a complaint window
- This protects against potential service quality issues while ensuring prompt expert payment

## Payout Timing Requirements

### Transfer Creation Requirements (Both Must Be Met)

1. **Payment Aging**: Payment must be 7+ days old

   - PT (Portugal): 7 days minimum
   - Other countries: 7 days minimum (configurable)
   - Purpose: Regulatory compliance and chargeback protection

2. **Service Delivery Window**: 24+ hours since scheduled appointment end
   - Purpose: Customer complaint window (like Airbnb's first-night hold)
   - Calculation: `appointment_start_time + event_duration + 24 hours`
   - Ensures customers have time to report service issues

### Payout Creation Requirements

- Transfer must be successfully completed
- Appointment must have ended 24+ hours ago
- Connect account must have sufficient available balance

## Payout Schedule Settings

The default payout schedule for all experts is set to **daily** with the country-specific minimum delay. This means:

1. Transfers are created after both payment aging and service delivery requirements are met
2. Payouts are created immediately after transfer completion
3. Only funds from appointments that ended 24+ hours ago are included

## Automated Payout Process

The platform uses a **two-phase approach** for expert payments:

### Phase 1: Transfer Creation

- **Cron Job**: `process-expert-transfers` (every 2 hours)
- **Purpose**: Creates Stripe transfers from platform account to Connect accounts
- **Timing**: After 7+ day payment aging AND 24+ hours post-appointment
- **Status**: Updates transfer status to `COMPLETED`

### Phase 2: Payout Creation

- **Cron Job**: `process-pending-payouts` (daily at 6 AM)
- **Purpose**: Creates Stripe payouts from Connect accounts to expert bank accounts
- **Timing**: Immediately after transfer completion (no additional delay)
- **Status**: Updates transfer status to `PAID_OUT`

## Example Timeline

**Day 0**: Customer books and pays for appointment scheduled for Day 8
**Day 8**: Appointment occurs (1 hour duration, ends at Day 8 + 1 hour)
**Day 8 + 25 hours**: First eligible time for transfer (7 days + 24 hours met)
**Day 8 + 25 hours**: Transfer created and payout sent to expert

## Compliance & Risk Management

This approach balances:

- **Regulatory compliance**: 7-day payment aging meets European regulations
- **Customer protection**: 24-hour complaint window for service issues
- **Expert cash flow**: Prompt payment after service delivery confirmation period
- **Platform risk**: Sufficient time to handle disputes and quality issues

## Future Improvements

After establishing a history with Stripe, some experts may become eligible for faster payouts. Stripe may reduce the minimum delay requirements for accounts with good track records. This is handled automatically by Stripe and doesn't require changes to our integration.

## Payout Timing Optimization

The platform optimizes expert payouts based on Stripe's payout delay requirements while ensuring experts receive their funds as quickly as possible after completing sessions. This is achieved using a "payment aging" approach:

### How Payment Aging Works

1. **Payment Receipt**: When a customer pays for a session, we record the payment timestamp.
2. **Session Completion**: After the expert completes the session, we calculate how many days have passed since the original payment.
3. **Delay Calculation**: We subtract this "payment aging" period from Stripe's required minimum delay:
   - `remainingDelay = max(1, requiredPayoutDelay - paymentAgingDays)`
4. **Optimized Payout**: The expert receives their payout after only the remaining delay (minimum 1 day).

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Same-day Booking**  
Customer books and pays for a session happening the same day.

- Payment aging: 0 days
- For a PT-based expert (7-day requirement):
  - Remaining delay = max(1, 7-0) = 7 days
  - Expert receives funds 7 days after the session

**Scenario 2: Advance Booking**  
Customer books and pays 10 days before the session occurs.

- Payment aging: 10 days
- For a PT-based expert (7-day requirement):
  - Remaining delay = max(1, 7-10) = 1 day
  - Expert receives funds the day after the session

**Scenario 3: US-based Expert with Advance Booking**  
Customer books and pays 5 days before the session occurs.

- Payment aging: 5 days
- For a US-based expert (2-day requirement):
  - Remaining delay = max(1, 2-5) = 1 day
  - Expert receives funds the day after the session

This approach ensures compliance with Stripe's requirements while optimizing for the fastest possible payouts to experts based on when the customer made the initial payment.

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration

The minimum payout delay settings are defined in `config/stripe.ts` in the `STRIPE_CONFIG.CONNECT.PAYOUT_DELAY_DAYS` object. This allows us to maintain a centralized list of country-specific requirements that can be updated as Stripe's policies change.

### Connect Account Creation

When creating a new Stripe Connect account, we automatically set the payout schedule with the appropriate minimum delay for the expert's country. This is handled in the `createStripeConnectAccount` function in `lib/stripe.ts`.

### Error Handling

If Stripe rejects a payout schedule setting (e.g., if we attempt to set a delay that's shorter than allowed), we catch this error and provide a clear explanation to the user about the minimum delay requirements for their country.
