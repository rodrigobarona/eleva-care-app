_Effective Date:_ April 16, 2025

Welcome to **Eleva.care** (operated by **Búzios e Tartarugas, Lda.**). By using Eleva.care, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.

## 1) What Eleva.care is (and isn't)

- Eleva.care is a trusted platform that connects people seeking care with independent, licensed care experts.
- Eleva.care is not a clinic, medical practice, or healthcare provider. We don't employ, supervise, or control experts, and we don't provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
- Experts on Eleva Care are independent, licensed in their jurisdictions, hold their own professional liability insurance, and are solely responsible for the care they provide.

## 2) What we provide

- Accounts, identity verification, and support
- For clients: search and discovery, booking and scheduling, payments (via Stripe), secure messaging, and your appointment history
- For experts: profile management, scheduling, encrypted notes (you control the content), payments and payouts (via Stripe Connect), secure client messaging, and encrypted file storage
- We do not provide medical services or verify medical credentials beyond expert self‑certification

Our features may change over time.

## 3) Accounts and eligibility

- You must be 18+ and able to enter a contract
- Provide accurate information, keep your credentials secure, and tell us if there’s unauthorized use of your account

- Claim to be a licensed professional if you’re not
- Use Eleva.care for emergencies

We may suspend or terminate access if these rules are violated.

## 5) Clients

- You choose your expert and should check their credentials and licensing
- Your care relationship is with the expert, not Eleva.care
- Eleva.care isn't responsible for the medical care you receive

- Are duly licensed and in good standing
- Maintain professional liability insurance
- Are solely responsible for the care you provide and for obtaining informed consent

- If there’s a payment issue, we’ll help you resolve it

## 8) Privacy

Your use is governed by our Privacy Policy. We process personal data in line with applicable law, including the GDPR where relevant.

## 9) Intellectual property

The Eleva.care platform, including text, graphics, logos, and software, is owned by Eleva.care or our licensors. Please don’t copy, use, or distribute our materials without permission.

## 10) Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

- We provide technology platform services "as is" and are responsible only for operating the platform
- We are not responsible for any medical care, advice, diagnosis, treatment, outcomes, or disputes between you and an expert

### Emergencies

Eleva.care is not for emergencies. If you need urgent help, call your local emergency number (EU: 112, US: 911) immediately.

## 11) Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold Eleva.care harmless from claims and costs arising from your misuse of the platform, violation of these Terms, or infringement of others’ rights.

## 12) Ending or suspending service

We may suspend or terminate access if Terms are violated or to protect our community. You can close your account anytime by contacting support. Any amounts owed remain due.

## 13) Governing law

These Terms are governed by Portuguese law. Courts in Portugal have jurisdiction over disputes related to these Terms or your use of Eleva.care.

## 14) Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms. We’ll notify you of material changes; continuing to use Eleva.care means you accept the updated Terms.

## 15) EU consumer information

- Your statutory consumer rights aren’t affected. You can use the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution platform: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr
- Right of withdrawal: Where applicable to certain non‑healthcare platform services, you may withdraw within 14 days unless you request immediate performance. For time‑specific healthcare services performed by independent experts, withdrawal may not apply once the service begins or for services scheduled for a specific date/time, as allowed by law.
