# Cookie Policy

_Effective Date: April 16, 2025_

We use a small number of cookies to run Eleva.care reliably and securely. This page explains what we use and how you can control it.

## 1) What we (don’t) store

- We never store clinical data or health information in cookies
- Cookies are used only for platform features, security, preferences, and minimal analytics

## 2) Types of cookies

- Essential: sign‑in/session, security (CSRF/fraud), load balancing
- Functional: language, theme, UI preferences
- Analytics (minimal, EU‑hosted PostHog): performance, errors, usage trends (aggregated/anonymized)

## 3) Duration

- Session cookies: removed when you close your browser
- Persistent cookies: typically up to 12 months (often much less)

## 4) Consent and control

- Non‑essential cookies load only after consent
- You can change choices anytime via “Cookie Preferences” in the footer
- You can also manage cookies in your browser settings

## 5) Providers we rely on (cookies may apply)

- Auth/identity: Clerk (EU options)
- Payments: Stripe (PCI DSS L1)
- Analytics: PostHog (EU hosting)
- Email/notifications/infra (EU endpoints/regions): Resend, Novu, Vercel, Upstash

All providers are under DPAs/SCCs as applicable and support EU data hosting.

## 6) Data location

We prioritize EU data residency. Cookie‑related data is processed in EU regions where available; otherwise, SCCs and supplementary measures apply.

## 7) Changing your mind

- Open the “Cookie Preferences” link in the footer to adjust categories
- Blocking essential cookies may impact sign‑in and core features

## 8) Updates

We review cookies regularly and may update this policy. We’ll reflect changes here and notify you of material updates.
