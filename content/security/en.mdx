## Our Commitment to Security

As a healthcare technology platform, Eleva.care understands that security isn't just a feature—it's the foundation of trust. We handle sensitive health information for practitioners and patients across Europe and Latin America, and we take this responsibility seriously.

Our security infrastructure is built on **GDPR**, **LGPD**, and **HIPAA-compliant** foundations, implementing industry-leading practices to protect your data at every layer of our platform.

## Certifications & Compliance

### Active Compliance Standards

✅ **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**  
Full compliance as a Portugal-based entity serving EU healthcare professionals and patients.

✅ **LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais)**  
Complete compliance with Brazilian data protection law (Lei nº 13.709/2018).

✅ **HIPAA-Ready Infrastructure**  
HIPAA-compliant database infrastructure through Neon.tech with executed Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

### Infrastructure & Vendor Certifications

Our security posture is strengthened by our infrastructure providers' formal certifications:

✅ **SOC 2 Type II Certified Infrastructure**

- **Clerk** (Authentication): SOC 2 Type II certified
- **Stripe** (Payments): SOC 2 Type II + PCI DSS Level 1
- **Vercel** (Hosting): SOC 2 Type II certified

✅ **ISO 27001-Aligned Security Practices**  
Our information security management follows ISO 27001 principles and best practices, implemented across our development lifecycle, infrastructure, and operational procedures.

For detailed compliance information, visit our [Data Processing Agreement](/legal/dpa). We conduct Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) and implement supplementary measures aligned with Schrems II (EU‑based key management, least‑privilege access, government request challenge and notice policies) to mitigate cross‑border access risks when using EU‑hosted infrastructure from non‑EU vendors.
