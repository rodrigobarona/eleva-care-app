# Security

_Last updated: October 1, 2025_

We take security seriously. Below is a clear, concise overview of how we protect your data and run a secure platform.

## 1) Compliance at the core

- GDPR and LGPD compliant as a Portugal‑based company
- HIPAA‑ready database (Neon.tech) with BAA executed
- Vendors with strong certifications: Clerk, Stripe, Vercel, Neon (SOC 2 Type II), Stripe (PCI DSS L1)
- ISO 27001‑aligned security practices across development and operations
- Details and full subprocessor list in our [Data Processing Agreement](/trust/dpa)

## 2) Technical safeguards

- Encryption at rest (AES‑256‑GCM) and in transit (TLS 1.3, HSTS, PFS)
- EU data residency by default (Neon DB Frankfurt; EU email, edge, cache, analytics, notifications)
- Network protections: WAF, DDoS mitigation, strict rate limiting, secure API gateway
- Database protections: pgAudit, SSL‑only, row‑level policies, automated backups
- Payments: processed by Stripe; we never store card data; 3DS supported

### Security headers & CSP

We deploy strict security headers following OWASP guidance:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=(), interest-cohort=()
X-Frame-Options: DENY  # or via CSP frame-ancestors 'none'
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://*.vercel.app https://*.stripe.com;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https://res.cloudinary.com;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  connect-src 'self' https://api.stripe.com https://*.posthog.com https://*.upstash.io;
  frame-src https://*.stripe.com https://*.google.com;
  frame-ancestors 'none';
  upgrade-insecure-requests;
```

Notes:

- We tune sources per environment (prod/stage) and minimize allowances.
- We prefer frame-ancestors in CSP over X-Frame-Options where supported.

## 3) Account and access security

- Clerk authentication with SSO, passwordless options, secure sessions
- MFA supported (SMS, TOTP, email fallback); enforced for admin
- Role‑based access control with least privilege and regular reviews

## 4) Secure development and operations

- Protected branches, peer reviews, SAST/DAST/SCA scanning (Snyk/Dependabot)
- Immutable deployments, zero‑downtime, rollback, staged releases
- Continuous monitoring, anomaly detection, error tracking, 99.9% uptime target
- Comprehensive audit logs; GDPR/LGPD/HIPAA‑aligned retention

## 5) Incident response

- 24/7 monitoring, documented runbooks, regulatory notifications (GDPR 72h, LGPD ANPD)
- Post‑incident reviews and user communications

## 6) People and third parties

- Quarterly access reviews, VPN for prod, MFA, background checks, annual training
- Vendor security reviews, DPAs with processors; access monitored and logged

## 7) Vulnerabilities and research

- Regular pentests and automated scanning; remediation SLAs: Critical 24‑48h, High 7d, Medium 30d, Low 90d
- Responsible disclosure: email `security@eleva.care` or open a GitHub security advisory; PGP available on request
- Please avoid automated scanning without permission, accessing unrelated data, premature disclosure, social engineering, or service disruption

## 8) Data privacy basics

- We collect the minimum necessary data and keep it only as long as needed
- You can access, correct, delete, limit, port, or object; contact `privacy@eleva.care` or `dpo@eleva.care`
- See our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy) for details

## 9) Resilience

- Automated backups with point‑in‑time recovery, geo‑redundancy
- RTO < 4h for critical systems; RPO < 15m for DB; quarterly restore drills
- High availability via multi‑region design, replication, and global edge caching
