# Payment Policies

_Effective Date: June 3, 2025_

This page explains how payments work on Eleva.care in plain language.

## 1) What you’re paying for

- Eleva.care is a trusted platform. Payments go to independent, licensed care experts for their services.
- Pricing shown at booking includes everything (no hidden fees):
  - Expert receives 85% of the appointment price
  - Eleva.care retains 15% as a platform fee (covers tech, infra, support, marketing, Stripe fees)

Example for €100: Expert €85, Platform fee €15.

## 2) Payment methods

- Cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
- Multibanco (Portugal)

## 3) Multibanco rules (when paying 8 or more days in advance)

- Not available for appointments taking place in 7 days or less
- When your appointment is 8 or more days away, we reserve your slot for 7 days while you pay
- You have 7 full days to complete payment
- We'll send reminders on day 3 and day 6 with instructions (ATM, online banking, MB WAY)

Late Multibanco payments (after 7 days): If the slot is no longer available or violates expert rules, we automatically refund 90% and retain a 10% processing fee, subject to applicable law and card network rules.

### Understanding the 10% Processing Fee

The 10% retention covers our actual operational costs when late payments result in lost bookings:

- Payment processing fees (Stripe, Multibanco): 2.5%
- Platform operations and compliance: 3%
- Administrative and support costs: 2.5%
- Expert time slot compensation: 2%

This fee is comparable to industry standards (Airbnb retains ~14% in similar situations) and helps maintain platform sustainability.

**First-time courtesy**: If this is your first late Multibanco payment, we waive the fee and refund 100%. Subsequent late payments are subject to the 10% retention.

## 4) Refunds for conflicts (late Multibanco)

- **First-time late payment**: 100% refund (courtesy waiver)
- **Subsequent late payments**: 90% refund, 10% retained as processing fee
- Refund time: typically 5–10 business days (via Stripe)
- We'll notify you by email.

If something went wrong (system error or edge case), contact support within 48 hours with your payment reference. We’ll review within 2 business days.

## 5) Choosing a payment method

- Card (instant):
  - Best for bookings within 8 days, last‑minute, or when you need instant confirmation
- Multibanco (7‑day window):
  - Best for bookings 8+ days ahead, local PT preference, comfortable with deferred payment

## 6) Expert payouts (Stripe Connect)

- Experts are independent and are paid via Stripe Connect after successful appointments
- Standard split: 85% expert / 15% platform
- Payout timing depends on expert settings and local bank rules

## 7) Currency and pricing

- Prices shown in EUR; processors may apply conversion for international cards
- Prices are locked at booking; no extra platform fees after confirmation (refund fees may apply as described in section 4)
- Taxes/fees included in the displayed price

## 8) Payment security and fraud

- We do not store card numbers; payments are processed by Stripe (PCI DSS compliant)
- We use encryption and fraud detection; suspicious transactions may be delayed/declined
- Additional verification may be required for high‑value payments

## 9) Chargebacks and disputes

- If a cardholder opens a dispute (chargeback), we follow Stripe’s process and provide evidence (booking logs, communications, policies). While the dispute is open, payouts for the related appointment may be delayed.
- Outcomes are determined by the card network. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, funds are released; otherwise, the charge is reversed per network rules.
- Repeated fraud/chargebacks may result in temporary restrictions or account review.

## 10) Strong Customer Authentication (3DS/PSD2)

- Where required (e.g., EEA), we use 3D Secure to comply with PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication.
- If 3DS is challenged and fails, the payment cannot be completed; you may retry with a different card or method.

## 11) Failed payments

- Failed payments cancel the booking automatically; you’ll be notified by email
- Retry by creating a new payment; repeated failures may temporarily restrict booking

## 12) Support and refunds

- Payment questions: `support@eleva.care` (we aim to respond within 24 hours)
- Refund requests: submit within 7 days of the original payment; medical emergencies are considered case‑by‑case; cancellation rules in our Terms apply

## 13) Updates and compliance

- We may update these policies; continued use means you accept updates
- We follow Portuguese consumer protection, EU PSD2, GDPR data requirements, and Stripe terms
