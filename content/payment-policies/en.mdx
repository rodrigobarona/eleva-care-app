# Payment Policies

_Effective Date: June 3, 2025_

This page explains how payments work on Eleva.care in plain language.

## 1) What you’re paying for

- Eleva.care is a technology marketplace. Payments go to independent, licensed practitioners for their services.
- Pricing shown at booking includes everything (no hidden fees):
  - Practitioner receives 85% of the appointment price
  - Eleva.care retains 15% as a platform fee (covers tech, infra, support, marketing, Stripe fees)

Example for €100: Practitioner €85, Platform fee €15.

## 2) Payment methods

- Cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
- Multibanco (Portugal)

## 3) Multibanco rules (when paying 8+ days in advance)

- Not available for appointments taking place within 8 days
- When your appointment is 8+ days away, we reserve your slot for 7 days while you pay
- You have 7 full days to complete payment
- We’ll send reminders on day 3 and day 6 with instructions (ATM, online banking, MB WAY)

Late Multibanco payments (after 7 days): If the slot is no longer available or violates practitioner rules, we automatically refund 90% (retain 10% processing fee).

## 4) Refunds for conflicts (late Multibanco)

- Automatic refund: 90% back, 10% retained as processing fee
- Refund time: typically 5–10 business days (via Stripe)
- We’ll notify you by email

If something went wrong (system error or edge case), contact support within 48 hours with your payment reference; we’ll review within 2 business days.

## 5) Choosing a payment method

- Card (instant):
  - Best for bookings within 8 days, last‑minute, or when you need instant confirmation
- Multibanco (7‑day window):
  - Best for bookings 8+ days ahead, local PT preference, comfortable with deferred payment

## 6) Practitioner payouts (Stripe Connect)

- Practitioners are independent and are paid via Stripe Connect after successful appointments
- Standard split: 85% practitioner / 15% platform
- Payout timing depends on practitioner settings and local bank rules

## 7) Currency and pricing

- Prices shown in EUR; processors may apply conversion for international cards
- Prices are locked at booking; no extra charges after confirmation
- Taxes/fees included in the displayed price

## 8) Payment security and fraud

- We do not store card numbers; payments are processed by Stripe (PCI DSS compliant)
- We use encryption and fraud detection; suspicious transactions may be delayed/declined
- Additional verification may be required for high‑value payments

## 9) Failed payments

- Failed payments cancel the booking automatically; you’ll be notified by email
- Retry by creating a new payment; repeated failures may temporarily restrict booking

## 10) Support and refunds

- Payment questions: `support@eleva.care` (we aim to respond within 24 hours)
- Refund requests: submit within 7 days of the original payment; medical emergencies are considered case‑by‑case; cancellation rules in our Terms apply

## 11) Updates and compliance

- We may update these policies; continued use means you accept updates
- We follow Portuguese consumer protection, EU PSD2, GDPR data requirements, and Stripe terms
