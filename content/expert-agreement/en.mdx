# Expert Service Agreement

_Effective Date: April 16, 2025_

Welcome to Eleva.care. This agreement explains, in plain language, how we work together when you offer services on our platform.

## 1) Your status (independent professional)

- You are an independent, licensed care professional—not our employee, partner, or agent
- You run your own practice: schedule, rates, policies, taxes, insurance, and regulatory compliance are yours to manage
- We don’t supervise your clinical decisions or provide medical services

## 2) Professional requirements

- Keep your license(s) valid and in good standing; tell us if anything changes
- Maintain professional liability (malpractice) insurance (keep proof available)
- Provide care consistent with law, ethics, informed consent, and clinical standards; keep accurate records and protect privacy

## 3) Data roles (GDPR/LGPD)

- For clinical notes/files you create, you are the Data Controller; Eleva.care is your Data Processor
- We store data securely and act only on your documented instructions; we provide encryption, access controls, audit, and breach notice
- You handle patient notices/consents, data subject requests, and retention rules for medical records
- See our [Data Processing Agreement](/trust/dpa) and [Security](/trust/security) pages for subprocessors and safeguards

## 4) Platform services (what we provide)

- Profile, availability, booking and scheduling tools
- Encrypted storage for your notes/files (you control content)
- Payments via Stripe Connect; patient messaging and notifications
- Technical support, plus GDPR assistance (when appropriate)

We do not provide medical advice or supervision, verify your credentials (you self‑declare), provide malpractice insurance, referrals, or billing/coding services.

## 5) Pricing, fees, and payouts

- You set your prices
- For each completed appointment: 85% to you, 15% platform fee (covers Stripe fees and platform costs)
- Payouts run through Stripe Connect, timing per your settings and bank rules
- You handle your taxes (income, VAT if applicable, social contributions). We provide transaction history and annual earnings summary

## 6) Patient relationship and care standards

- Your relationship is directly with the patient; obtain informed consent and maintain confidentiality
- The platform is not for emergencies; communicate appropriate emergency guidance (EU: 112, US: 911)
- Follow telehealth rules where relevant (licensing, location checks, standard of care)

## 7) Prohibited behavior

- Don’t misrepresent credentials, practice beyond your scope, violate privacy, engage in misconduct/illegal activity, bypass platform payments, or solicit off‑platform to avoid fees
- Violations may lead to suspension or termination

## 8) Term and termination

- Starts when your expert account is created and continues until either of us ends it
- You can close your account; complete/cancel booked visits and meet record‑keeping duties
- We may suspend/terminate for license issues, fraud/illegality, serious misconduct, or policy breaches
- Upon termination, we provide an export of your data; you remain responsible for legally required retention

## 9) Liability

- You are solely responsible for the care you provide and for maintaining required insurance
- Eleva.care’s responsibility is limited to operating the technology platform and reasonable security measures
- You agree to indemnify Eleva.care for claims arising from your medical practice, regulatory breaches, or violations of this agreement

## 10) IP, confidentiality, and notices

- Eleva.care owns the platform; you own your clinical notes, profile, and materials
- You grant us permission to display your profile and store/backup your data; we may use aggregated, anonymized data to improve the platform
- Keep business/technical information confidential; follow healthcare privacy laws for patient data
- Notices: support@eleva.care (legal: legal@eleva.care, DPO: dpo@eleva.care)

## 11) Updates, law, and disputes

- We may update this agreement; we’ll provide notice and request acceptance for material changes
- Governing law: Portugal. Disputes: good‑faith negotiation → mediation → courts of Portugal
