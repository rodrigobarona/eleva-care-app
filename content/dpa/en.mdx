# Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

_Effective Date: April 16, 2025_

This DPA explains how Eleva.care handles personal data—clearly and simply.

## 1) Who does what

- Eleva.care is a healthcare technology marketplace. We are not a healthcare provider.
- Two roles:
  - Controller (platform operations: accounts, bookings, payments, analytics, support)
  - Processor (clinical notes/files that practitioners create: we store securely on their instructions)

## 2) When we are Controller (platform)

- We use trusted processors to run the platform:
  - Database/infra & delivery: Neon (EU), Vercel (EU regions), Upstash (EU), Resend (IE), Novu (EU endpoint)
  - Identity/SSO: Clerk (EU options), Google SSO
  - Payments: Stripe (PCI DSS L1)
  - Analytics: PostHog (EU hosting option)
- We require DPAs/SCCs, security controls, and EU data residency where available.

## 3) When we are Processor (for practitioners)

- Practitioners are Controllers of clinical data; we are their Processor.
- We act only on documented instructions, keep data encrypted (at rest and in transit), and maintain RBAC and audit logs.
- Subprocessors for clinical data storage (EU): Neon (DB Frankfurt), Vercel (hosting EU), Upstash (cache EU). We notify before changes.

## 4) Security at a glance

- TLS 1.3 in transit; AES‑256‑GCM at rest (clinical data)
- Least privilege/RBAC; MFA available; audit logging; encrypted backups; DR plans
- 24‑hour breach notice SLA to Controllers for clinical data

## 5) International transfers

- We prioritize EU data residency. Where non‑EU vendors provide EU hosting, we rely on SCCs + supplementary measures (encryption, key controls, access logging, challenge overbroad requests).

## 6) Retention and deletion

- Platform data: kept only as long as needed or required by law
- Clinical data: retention is set by the practitioner (e.g., 10 years under PT rules). On instruction/termination, we export and delete following a short grace period and backup window.

## 7) Data subject rights

- Platform (Controller): We handle access, correction, deletion, portability, restriction, and objection requests.
- Clinical (Processor): We provide tools so practitioners can fulfill patient requests.

## 8) Practitioner responsibilities (as Controller)

- Obtain informed consent where needed; ensure lawful basis (e.g., GDPR Art. 9(2)(h))
- Set retention; respond to rights requests; maintain accuracy; carry malpractice insurance

## 9) Our responsibilities (as Processor)

- Follow instructions; keep data secure; assist with rights requests and DPIAs; notify breaches without undue delay; return/delete data on request; limit transfers; keep confidentiality

## 10) Liability

- Eleva.care: liable for platform tech and security as described
- Practitioners: liable for clinical decisions, patient outcomes, and compliance as Controllers

## 11) Updates, law, and disputes

- We may update this DPA with notice for material changes
- Governing law: Portugal; venue: courts of Portugal
