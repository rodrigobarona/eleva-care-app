# Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

_Effective Date:_ April 16, 2025

**IMPORTANT**: Eleva.care is a **healthcare technology marketplace platform** that connects patients with independent, licensed healthcare practitioners. We are NOT a healthcare provider. This Data Processing Agreement explains how we handle data in our **dual role** as both Data Controller and Data Processor.

## Our Dual Role in Data Processing

Eleva.care processes personal data in **two distinct capacities**:

### 🟦 As Data Controller (Platform Operations)

For platform functionality, we are the **Data Controller** and use technology vendors as our processors:

- User accounts (practitioners and patients)
- Booking and scheduling information
- Payment processing
- Platform analytics
- Communications and support

### 🟧 As Data Processor (Clinical Data Storage)

For clinical notes and medical records created by practitioners, we are the **Data Processor**:

- Healthcare practitioners are the **Data Controllers**
- We provide secure encrypted storage only
- We process data only on practitioner instructions
- We do NOT access clinical content without authorization
