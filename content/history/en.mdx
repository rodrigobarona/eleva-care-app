## Hello!

I'm Patrícia Mota, a physiotherapist, and I wanted to share with you how Eleva Care came to be.

Movement has been part of my life since I was little - first in rhythmic gymnastics, then in synchronized swimming. When I became a physiotherapist, I worked mainly with musculoskeletal and orthopedic problems. That's when I encountered a challenge: when my patients became pregnant, I didn't feel prepared to answer their questions. I'll admit it bothered me not having clear answers for those who trusted me.

## The Academic Journey

This feeling led me to pursue a PhD in Biomechanics with Professor Kari Bø, studying how abdominal muscles adapt during pregnancy and after childbirth. Meanwhile, I became a mother of three children and experienced firsthand many of the issues I was studying.

I realized something important: **despite solid scientific research existing, there's an enormous gap between the knowledge produced and what reaches people.**

## The Problem I Discovered

On one hand, we already have substantial evidence about effective strategies for women's health, but this knowledge often remains "trapped" in scientific articles that are difficult to access and understand for those not in the field. Information takes time to be translated into clinical practice and even longer to reach the general public.

At the same time, we see daily on social media promises of quick solutions for complex women's health issues - from "returning to the pre-pregnancy body" in record time to miraculous exercises for urinary incontinence. Most concerning is that these "solutions" are often just sophisticated marketing strategies, without any scientific foundation.

**What worries me is not just the misinformation, but how it can drive women away from approaches that actually work**, based on scientific evidence and clinical experience. Symptoms like incontinence, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, or musculoskeletal changes have proven solutions that often don't reach those who need them.

## The Moment of Inspiration

In the past two years, while working on a research project in California with Jenny Bagwell, I missed my patients. This distance made me think: **why not create a way to bring quality information and specialized care to all women, regardless of where they are?**

That's when Rodrigo, my husband, put all these pieces together and created the Eleva Care platform. Perhaps we're reinventing the wheel a bit, after all.

## Our Mission

We want to build a bridge between the most current science and the people who need it, but in a truly accessible way - **world-class women's healthcare, available when and where it's needed.**

Our vision is simple: allow any woman to book appointments with leading specialists in women's health, adapting to her schedule and location, not the other way around.

## The Team That Makes Me Proud

When I spoke about this idea with colleagues I admire, the response was warm and immediate. Today we have a group of advisors who fill me with pride and gratitude. They are extraordinarily experienced professionals, true references in each of their areas of specialization.

More than that, they are human beings for whom I have immense affection and who have already contributed significantly to what Eleva Care is today. Their generosity in sharing knowledge, experience, and vision has been fundamental to our growth.

At the same time, we are building a clinical team composed of professionals I deeply trust, who share the same values and the same passion for evidence-based care.
