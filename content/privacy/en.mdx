# Privacy Policy

_Effective Date:_ April 16, 2025

At **Eleva.care** ("we," "us," "our"), we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal data when you use our **technology platform services**.

**IMPORTANT**: Eleva.care is a **healthcare technology marketplace platform** that connects patients with independent, licensed healthcare practitioners. We are NOT a healthcare provider. This Privacy Policy covers how WE (Eleva.care) handle your platform data. Your healthcare practitioner has their own separate responsibilities for the medical data they create.

By using or accessing Eleva.care's platform services, you agree to the collection and use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Eleva.care's Dual Role in Data Processing

Eleva.care processes your data in **two distinct capacities**:

- Your account information (name, email, phone number)
- Booking and scheduling information
- Payment information (processed via Stripe)
- Platform usage analytics
- Communications with our support team

**Legal Basis**: Contract performance (GDPR Article 6(1)(b))

### As Data Processor (Clinical Data Storage)

For clinical session notes and medical records created by practitioners:

- **The healthcare practitioner is the data controller**
- **Eleva.care provides secure encrypted storage only**
- We process this data ONLY on the practitioner's instructions
- We do NOT access clinical notes without authorization

**Legal Basis**:

- Practitioners rely on GDPR Article 9(2)(h) (healthcare provision)
